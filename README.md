##  Coursera Review Sentiment Analysis: A Focus on Instructors and Content

This project explores Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification (ABSC) in the context of Coursera course reviews. 

**What is ABSC?**

ABSC is a field within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that goes beyond general sentiment analysis. It aims to identify sentiment targeted at specific aspects or features mentioned in text. 

**What are we doing?**

* We're proposing new methods and techniques to improve the accuracy of ABSC. 
* We're focusing on Coursera course reviews, a unique data source with valuable insights for educational platforms. 
* We're specifically analyzing sentiments towards instructors and course content, two key aspects of online learning experiences.

**Why Coursera Reviews?**

Coursera reviews offer a rich dataset with specific challenges and opportunities for sentiment analysis. 

* This research will not only improve general sentiment analysis techniques but also provide valuable insights for:
    * Researchers in NLP and educational technology
    * Practitioners who design and manage online learning platforms
    * Developers who build sentiment analysis systems for educational platforms
