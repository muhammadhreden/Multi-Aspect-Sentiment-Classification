1,"First of all, it's a great honor to be part of this special course. I learned a lot, really. I'm an ICT teacher for technology although we don't have the best technology in the Philippines but we can absolutely use the tools you've provided and taught us. I enjoyed this course sooooooooo much."
2,"I've taken and finished part 1 and part 2 of this course. There is a ton of information and skills learned. The practice problems are not necessary for your final grade, but the quizzes and mini-projects are. I really recommend doing the practice problems as they help to pound in some fundamentals that are beyond syntax. In fact, I went and practiced much of these in both codeskulptor and in the python interpreter using python 2 and 3 using tkinter as my gui in the latter cases. With this in mind I went ahead and saved the pages that had the practice problems because they are that good for rehearsing.
The pace of the course may seem slow at first, but it quickly gains momentum and at times can be moderately fast, that's why I'm going to say again, do the practice problems and devote enough time to it while it is slow, it will make everything that much easier in the long run.
I had only grabbed a basic feel of programming and python using codecademy right before enrollment of this class, it was helpful to do, but there is so much more covered in these courses. At this point I'm now able to dive into other peoples codes, while there is much to learn still, I can contribute to some projects and write much of my own.
I tried out several other classes for programming at the same time and felt the structure here made more sense and was better targeted for the goal of both learning python and transferable programming techniques. Sad to say that I dropped out of all other classes because I had one problem or another with them, but did not have any problem with these guys here. I trust anything from these guys and am now going for the full specialization.
Careful on later quizzes, as they start expecting that you pay attention and look at provided documentation and try some things out, some trick questions are about, you'll find them as ""technically this is it"", just keep in mind about how the code is evaluating and what the goal of the question is for which ""technically"" you are dealing with.
During early stages of these (part1 and part2) courses, my wife was getting on my case about wasting time, but now she sees the programs I'm writing and wrote both in later stages of these courses and on my own that she started drilling me to get into my lessons and write some programs so that one day I can make her more money, basically, she's proud, it's become more of a family thing for them to look at what I'm making and make suggestions.
As I write this I have three programs, out of the dozens I've written on my own, running in the background, handling bitcoin price and address monitoring, handling transactions, making and using new key pairs for said transactions, saving and backing up files, all in python. I've also made some simple simulators and mini-games all from scratch, with the foundation I have gotten from here.
Thanks for reading, I definitely recommend this course and think everyone needs to at least learn this much logic as the minimum for everyday life.

3,"This course is very well structured, guiding you through the basics of Python. Some big pros for the course:

- Engaging profs explain things clearly and and are entertaining, particularly Joe Warren and Scott Rixner
- They have created a simple browser-based Python programming environment for students to use--so no compilers or environments to download, you can create, run, and save your code via your browser...this makes it easy to just focus on learning to code
- Each of the weekly assignments is focused on creating games (which get more complex), making it fun & interesting

Only a few cons:

- Because the assignments are games, I felt the coding topics we learned were geared towards visual games--thus, quite a bit about drawing objects on the screen and making them move around. As I was not interested in using Python for visual apps (though interesting for exercises), I would have preferred to spend more time on other concepts.
- The material on class methods came towards the end and was brief, I would have liked to have seen it sooner and worked with it more

All in all, highly recommended! The instructors have just announced a couple more CS MOOCs from Rice, and I expect them to be equally well thought out and instructive."
4,"I had an excellent time in this class!

I have taken several other programming classes before, but would not classify myself as a computer scientist or software engineer by any means. Compared to classes I took in University, this course did a substantially better job of laying out basic concepts, explaining their functionality and pitfalls, and giving a number of programming examples to explore how they work even further.

The opening weeks start off with basic concepts, and very much feels geared toward a novice programmer. This is a good thing! While I may have already understood the concepts in other languages, I really appreciated the earnestness with which the fundamentals were covered. I feel like other classes tend to breeze through easier concepts to get to more complex concepts, but this means that if someone doesn't grasp the basics, they will struggle later. This class avoids that by spending adequate time at each step of the way.

The notion of being able to write a game after 8-9 weeks after learning a new language from scratch was not only intriguing, but very doable! The mix of lecture videos, quizzes, and mini-projects help give students a well-rounded understanding of the material, which I greatly preferred over having one midterm and one final. Simply put, they teach you to program by having you actually program!

The forums are an excellent resource, and the additional practice examples are a great way to really dive in to the concepts and understand them better. The two things I wish I did more of as a student were:

1) Do all of the practice examples

2) Participate more in the forums

I took this course for training at my job, which is great because I was able to do the materials in my own time, and wasn't stuck to such a stringent schedule. Given that I had to do the course during work hours, it precluded me from diving in to some more extracurricular aspects of the class (practice examples, adding features to my mini-projects), but aside from that, the class was very manageable within a work week.

PROS:

- Excellent coverage of Python from basic concepts to writing a working game

- Mini-projects are nearly all games, so the programming is fun!

- Can do the course work on your own time

- FREE

- Flexible, easy to use SimpleGUI

- The entire class is online, and no files need to be submitted - just URLs that contain your code

CONS:

- None come to mind!

- Seriously, nothing. Even with some programming experience, the class didn't feel like it lagged, and it never pushed forward too far to make it stressful. The whole class stayed fun and lighthearted, and serves as an excellent Introduction to Programming class (with better results than most!)

Synopsis: The class is very worth your time!"
5,"With a lot of new instructors teaching online, and new platforms, I believe the diversity is to increase the competition, and more successful platforms/classes will appear. However, although this course is a little old, it provides you with exercises, exam-like questions (really great questions), project assignments and you are graded by another peer for your project assignments, and you do not get this on many other platforms or with other courses.

What's even greater is, all other students/learners are willing to help or comment on your assignment. I have taken courses from other platforms and instructors, but none of them provided this type of practice for me, and I believe practice is almost everything in learning, especially when it comes to learning a programming language.

Also, the instructors here knew what to do and how to do it. It is clear that they have a certain timetable and lesson plan for teaching the contents, and it helps a lot with the process. Just like real classes, I've always had many questions in my head, but the answers were either provided in the videos, or I was helped along the way with the exercises/projects, or I was encouraged to make some research on what I was looking for. I don't think online teaching gets any better than this. However, I must admit, as a non-native speaker of English, I had a lot of difficulty in understanding some instructions on assignments. :) Yes, I can speak/write English very well, but I was not taught any school subjects in English.

Before taking the first part in An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, I had no previous knowledge on programming languages. I took the first part a year ago, and now I'm taking the second part. I felt the need to come back to this course because of all the advantages I mentioned above. In addition to those, I didn't feel any good at problem solving. This course was great at pushing me towards solving different problems, thinking analytically and teaching me how to compute for the exercises along the way. Teaching some core concepts should be easy, but with the exercises and their ways of using/teaching algorithms, how to use computations for different problems, I am now confident to say that I have a better understanding of programming languages and how to write an application or solve problems upon encountering one when writing code.

One more thing, they are fun to watch. Sometimes it gets too analytical, beyond my Mathematics knowledge, but they are certainly fun to watch. :)

Anyone will surely learn a lot from this course, however, I had difficulty for some of the assignments, and some of them, I believe, were due to my lack of knowledge in Math, and some of them were because I am not a native speaker of English. So, if there is any beginner out there, just like me, with zero knowledge on programming, reading this comment, if you do not have the dedication, you might feel a little hesitant for some exercises in this course, but the effort you put into this course will pay off ten folded."
6,"I really liked Profs Warren and Rixner's way of delivering the course, and the use of game design is a very interesting way to get the message of programming across and also to provide a means of practicing the material taught in the course. The peer-review system remains one of the best I have seen in Coursera to date, with the requirements clear and easy for everyone (both marker and student) to understand. It is also easy to review assignments and find out why marks were deducted, as well as columns allowing the reviewer to add comments and suggestions.

This course is, however, not quite as basic as the course information implies! I took quite a lot of time each week just to understand the game template and to figure out how to make the game work. Some prior background in programming might have helped - I had zero experience prior to this course (nonetheless I managed to complete it!)."
7,"This is a great introduction to MOOC's and to programming in general. I am a programmer with many, many years of experience (hair grayer than Joe's). I wanted to see what this MOOC thing was about and chose their class as I had never taken a formal class in Python and wanted to write a version of one of my childhood games - Asteroids.

First, Dr. Rixner has written a great development tool, CodeSkulptor, which by its nature of being in a hosted/cloud environment allows anyone to take the class from anywhere - shared machine, home computer, etc. Is it Enterprise capable? No, but it does allow almost any student with a basic internet connection the ability to focus on the code and the results without worrying about their environment. I think this sets a great bar for any MOOC class trying to teach such a wide range of students.

Second, the course teaches some of the most fundamental, but important concepts of programming. They did this without losing site of the end result of what they were wanting to accomplish breaking up the class material in a way which started with the basics and then gently introducing major concepts of both OO Programming, the Python language and in Game programming.

The focus here is on Introduction to the core building blocks and some of the best practices you will use time and time again. I particularly liked their introduction and reinforcement of Lists, Dictionaries and Sets without getting hung up in the algorithms behind it. I also liked how they would go thru and cover common mistakes and introduce the ideas of best practices.

Will you cover advanced topics such as Inheritance, Pickling, Profiling? No, but what they teach here will give any person the basic building blocks to allow them to move on as they need. They also have done a great job in selecting and building upon core ideas in the projects such that the final project, RiceRocks - a clone of Asteroids, happens naturally. Most Intro classes I've taken over the years have never given such an immediate and positive sense of accomplishment.

And last of all, they did a great job in making this a fun class. It is obvious that these men spent a lot of time developing the material.

Take this class if you want to learn a little about programming, take this class if you want to learn a little about Python, take this class if you want to learn a little about gaming programming, or be like me and take this class as a fun diversion to see what this MOOC thing is about."
8,"It is both a sad and a happy moment, as we come to the end of the session. My daily mornings start at 5am with this course, and I am not sure what I am supposed to do now, that the course has come to an end. At the same time, I am really happy to see the gradual transition in myself, in terms of my programming skills. There are have bee many times when I used to laugh my heart out. Scott and Joe made it really engaging and kept us hooked.

On a more technical perspective, I would love to thank John for the wonderful Python documentation. The course was well structured and felt the topics were well covered. Especially, I come to realize how powerful lists could be from this course. Those examples in the documentation were really helpful.

Of course, there could be some areas that we can improve on.

1. The first area that i feel we could improve is, our over-reliance on simplegui. Although it is a very nice tool and helps to get things done, at some point, I started to feel we were spending most of the time on it. I do understand, you need some library of that sort to build games, but if it was some library like the PyGame, I think it would have been much better.

2. Another thing I feel that could be improved is, there is probably too much spoon feeding from the instructor's end. Although this is a beginner level course, providing the templates, and literally discussing the logic that needs to be implemented in the game, could have been avoided. If that is intentional for this distance education course, then it is OK, but we would love to have an advanced course, where we are let to do things more by ourselves.

Request:

Python for Game Development was awesome. Same way, I would love to see a course on Python, specifically for scripting. This is something, that is not taught anywhere. Learning this skill, I am very sure , our efficiency would be boosted.

On the whole, it was a wonderful experience. I am really thankful to the entire team for making this course a HUGE SUCCESS. Can't wait for the next course offering. :)"
9,"I am probably an atypical student. I am retired, in my seventies and took this course for fun and to try to keep my mind sharp. I have no intention of becoming a professional programmer. In my past, I have had experience with several programming languages including Python.

I thought this course had several advantages over other online programming instruction. First, it provides a browser-based Python programming environment called CodeSkuptor. This means that you don't need to download the Python language onto your computer and you can access the course from anywhere.

Second, the program is project-based. Each week you have to complete a programming project which is a game. Programming is a skill and you need to practice that skill. This course provides you with that practice in a fun and challenging way.

Third, it doesn't overwhelm the student with too much information. It only introduced the programming constructs you need to complete each weeks project. So you have a limited amount of conceptual information to master and you get to apply that knowledge in completing that week's project. I found the course (both Part 1 and Part 2) challenging and I spent a good deal of time learning the concepts and creating the programs, more than what was suggested.

I really think that some prior experience in programming in any language would be very helpful in completing this course.

Finally, the one weakness of this course is the difficulty in getting feedback. There is a forum for posting questions, but I found that getting answers to questions could take more than a week, and sometimes they never got answered. Also, this is a weak implementation of a forum, for which I blame Coursera, not instructors.

This course was developed some years ago and it continues to be offered, but with what appears to be less active student support than in the beginning. So often, I went on the web with my Python questions and found the answers I needed there.

If you take this course I recommend that you always do the exercises each week. They will teach you important concepts and programming techniques which will be useful in the weekly projects.

Overall, I would recommend this course for the intelligence of it's design and implementation with the caveats I have previously discussed."
10,"Before starting this review, I'd like to provide some context about myself.

I am a medical student with no prior programming experience. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that prior to ~2 years ago, I really disliked computers. However, something clicked in my head and I realized that everything I believed about computers was essentially wrong. Computing is a fundamental skill that every professional should have, at least at some level.

That being said, this course (part 1 and 2) has been simply amazing. It was one of the first courses I took when I began my journey into computer science. I did not take this course in isolation. Rather, I supplemented with textbooks and other resources, such MITs 6.001 and 6.002. courses, Think Python by Allen Downey, Intro to Programming with MATLAB (Vanderbilt). The beauty of this course is that it is truly meant for beginners. And it carries your attention the entire time because of the great teaching and projects along the way. It focuses on the fundamentals, which is exactly what a novice needs. From my perspective, trying to enter the field of CS feels like a gargantuan task, especially in today's world. There is simply too much to learn and it is next to impossible to know where to start. This course (and really the specialization) provides that backbone of fundamentals needed for someone new to the field to grab on to. The best advice I have is to just start here and see what happens. Again, important to supplement with other materials because this is not easy stuff. You have to take it seriously and be passionate about it. I had finished my third year of medical school and had serious ambivalence about my future career. I decided to take an independent study year to learn as much CS as possible (in the context of medical imaging). The problem was not having a clue where to start. This course was a life-saver. If you are truly sincere about learning this material, you will be compelled to reach out to other resources as you work your way through the course.

Can't say enough good things. Thanks to the course instructors - you guys were awesome."
11,"On the whole, this was a great experience. The instructors (Scott Rixner, Joe Warren, and John Greiner) clearly care about the quality of the course, and take extra steps to make the course fun with their geeky humor. Rather than dump full lectures online, each short video is specifically designed for online delivery

All is not perfect, however. The course is billed as an introductory course, and while this is technically true, the learning curve is pretty steep and the workload fairly demanding. Each week adds a handful of new concepts, and you immediately apply them in building the week’s project, which is often complicated.

I found the projects very challenging. I’d pretty much start each week’s project during the back half of the course in a total panic, not having any idea how I was going to be able to complete the work. After an hour or two of hyperventilating and blundering my way through things, I’d eventually get some traction and start making progress. This often involved looking for answers to my questions on the forums, going back through previous videos to relearn concepts that I’d forgotten from previous weeks, and just plain trying lots of things to see what happened"
12,"This class is excellent.

I completely agree with all the positive comments.

The instructors are just fantastic. Each lecture is well presented and their enthusiasm for teaching really shines through. You also get a good sense of their fun, geeky personalities.

It is clear that the course instructors have put a lot of work into putting together this course. It is very well thought out and presented.

I have never programmed before and I really feel like I have received a very solid grounding in Python. Also, the projects for each week require you to program a computer game, making it fun to complete the assignments.

As a complete beginner, I did have to invest a lot of time each week to complete the assignments on time (up to 15 hours or so a week as the assignments got more difficult). But, it was well worth it and I felt such a sense of accomplishment as I successfully completed each program.

This course provides a lot of resources for students to get help and feedback on their programs, which is very useful for beginners.

There is a lot of peer (fellow students) and Teaching Assistant help (as well as responses from the instructors) via the class discussion forums, so even if you fall behind on the submission schedule (for the assignments), you can continuing working on the projects (even after the course has ended) as it is easy to get feedback on all your work. In fact, it gets a little bit addictive! So, even if you don't always have the time to put into this course, you can still follow it and complete it in your own time, and it is well worth the effort if you are interested in learning programming.

This is the very first on-line learning course I have taken and it has set a very high standard.

I enjoyed it immensely and I hope to continue learning to program in Python."
13,"Well worth your time. When you finish, you will know enough to address most of your coding requirements (""be dangerous""), or know where to find what you need to know. Instruction is competent, clear and concise and exercises are well integrated. I found they were classes I looked forward to.

I have almost 50 years experience (anyone recall punched cards, paper tape and front panel switch coding?) and have learned many languages, now Python. I have experienced learning from reference manuals (not recommended), tutorials, self taught, formal courses, ""on the job""; this course has been one of the best

One of the major obstacles to learning a new language is getting to writing the code and getting results; this course is superb in this respect. You bring up your browser, go to coursera, then to the course, click CODESKULPTOR and start coding. Results are immediate and clear (well maybe a little interpretation is required) and corrections are simple. You do not have to find or install anything - all you need to do is learn the Python coding rules (syntax) and programming rules (logic). And as all your code is in the cloud you are not limited to a location or machine

The lectures are concise, to the point and related to the current task and can be downloaded and reviewed anytime without access to the web.

While the course exercises develop games, all of the programming techniques are applicable to non-gaming applications; the games - familiar to everyone - provide highly entertaining motivation.

I would estimate you need no more than 6 to 10 hours per week depending on your experience although you could devote a lot more if you want to (I did).

In short - time well spent and a nod of appreciation to the instructors

14,"The Introduction to Interactive Programming course offered by Rice University is an excellent course for anyone interested in learning programming fundamentals. The course is designed to be accessible to beginners, yet still provides enough depth to challenge experienced programmers. The course uses Python, which is a widely-used and versatile programming language.

The course content is structured around programming assignments, which are designed to be engaging and interactive. The assignments include building games and animations, which help to keep the course interesting and fun. The instructors provide clear and concise explanations of programming concepts and are available to answer questions and provide feedback on assignments.

One of the standout features of this course is its emphasis on collaboration and community. Students are encouraged to work together and help each other, and the course includes a forum where students can discuss assignments and share ideas. This collaborative environment helps to foster a sense of community and support, which can be especially helpful for beginners.

Overall, the Introduction to Interactive Programming course is a fantastic resource for anyone looking to learn programming fundamentals in a fun and engaging way. The course content is high-quality, the instructors are knowledgeable and supportive, and the collaborative environment is a great asset. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to learn programming or improve their skills."
15,"Interactive programming in python is a great course for everybody wanting to learn the basics of python programming. In my opinion, it is especially suitable for beginners who have no or only some experience in programming. When I started this course, I had no experience in programming except for some very basic and simple codes I learned to do in Java. So every week was a challenge and it sometimes took me several days to complete a game - but that is all worth it once you have produced a working code, because this literally is one of the best feelings ever!
I first dropped the course when it came to object orientation - I didn't get any of what was going on and I didn't have much time to really get into it. But about two years later, I remembered the course and decided to give it another shot as the course had already tought me more than I would ever have thought to be possible. I did the whole course all over to refresh my memory and when it came to object orientation, I didn't give up again but saw it through and eventually, I understood its concept. What a great feeling!! After that, I had far less problems with the remaining weeks than I thought I would have.

What I wanna say with this: Interactive programming in python makes it possible for everyone to understand and learn how to write programs in python. You might have to be patient, but the course provides all the information you need in order to succeed. So if you're stuck, don't give up, go back a little and watch the videos again or browse the forums. I also highly recommend to do the practice exercises real carefully as I had the impression that those helped me the most to really understand what was being tought in the videos.

However, what the course does not teach in my opinion, is the ability to develop the idea of how a program must look like to produce the result you want. The students are told step by step what to do - they have to implement the idea in python, but they don't have to come up with the idea itself. But I think this is pretty hard to realize in an online course and I think this is not even the goal of this course, so still giving it 5 stars.

So to conclude: Thanks a lot to all of the instructors - I had a great time, much fun and learned quite a lot in this course! :-)"
16,"This course really helped me in developing interest towards python 2 as a person with zero coding experience I really liked how the instructors started from very scratch and slowly developed the level of concept and teaching. The interface of code skulptor was also nice but I really think that considering modern day coding standards the class should incorporate a bit more advanced code editor, Which will not only save time but will also enhance speed and accuracy while coding. One thing that stands out the most is how the teaching was done keeping things simple what I mean is, how the level and complexity how mini projects kept on elevating as the course progressed and I felt no burden thanks to the amazing programming tips and a very clear explanation of how I was supposed to approach the projects. At last I want to thank all the instructors who left no stones unturned in order to make the course virtually interactive. It was a great learning experience."
17,"As a programming language Python is excellent for beginners to professionals. It has all the features of other languages but is easy to learn and you can get results immediately. The Python class from Rice on Coursera.org is excellent and the instructors are superb. They provide all the material you need from websites for course material, to a programming webpage (codeskulptor.org) to extra material and programs you can run and read yourself.

The course has weekly video lectures that are paced slowly so you can take notes or just sit back and watch. The instructors post handouts for you as well. The quizzes give you a chance to stretch what you learn and to try new ideas that bring home the lectures. The quizzes are actually fun and a good learning experience of themselves. Because there is no grade for the course, you can take the quizzes up to five times and learn more and more from each one.

The projects were great fun to build and see run. The instructors give you a template for each project so you're not starting from scratch. And, what is more, they give you a step by step list of how to build your program, one piece at a time. This makes the projects easier and you know what to do as you go. I don't think it limits your learning but rather gives you a way to organize what you've learned and then apply it to the program.

When your project is done, you have a URL for it and, if you want, you can send the URL to friends who can then play the games you programmed. I actually ran one of the games on my phone; it's not great on the small screen, but it did run which was cool.

The lecturers have fun teaching and that makes the course much more enjoyable. The class is fun for them, so it's fun for you, too. I used the forums once for help and sure enough, a student answered my question there. (The best browser for the course is Chrome which we had to use for Space (or Rice) Asteroids, the last project. If you use Firefox, and I did, you'll find some quirks like the arrow keys don't work right so go with Chrome and make life easier.)

If you want to learn programming, and do so in a popular language that is easy to learn, this course is for you.

Good luck and have fun, I sure did.

18,"The OOP week was a very, very big hurdle for me and I had to pay my dues and work really hard to get over it and see the light... The BlackJack week cost me many, many hours, most of these spent wondering if I would get it!

But man!!! Was that worth it!

It is not to say that I've mastered anything yet, just that I am in awe at the power and possibility, and let's say it, the beauty, elegance and simplicity of it.

The ease with which I just completed RiceRocks is telling of the skill of our teachers: I started the course with a little bit of functional programming experience from a past life at UNI 30 years ago, and a strong interest in setting up my own personal exploration laboratory, but with zero experience in OOP and/or games;

What looked like an impossibly daunting task became feasible and deeply enjoyable little step after baby step late in the night.

What have I learned?

I am taking away many, many things from this course, but there are two that stand out:

1- If you are going to do anything, set out to do it right, or don't do it. This is what the Rice University team did; Pr. Rixner, Pr. Warren & al. spent countless hours to offer us all this gift; I am deeply grateful fot their efforts. I am hoping for a chance to give back a little on this gift and would gladly like to be a TA for the next session.

2- The key (to me) is in the description of the project: The architecture of the template together with the step by step guide are what make things possible --> it does not matter the scope of your project, if you are able to see the outcome, structure it properly, and cut it down into bite size chunks, then even the widest (or is it wildest?) scope becomes possible.

I will do this course again, maybe with the objective of achieving the projects without the use of the templates and step by step guides provided...

J. F. Kennedy asked ""Why does Rice play Texas?"" in his speech to launch the Apollo missions... I think this course gave us an insight:

Make no mistake, this course is hard; that's why we love it!

Thanks a million!"
19,"This was an excellent course.

Pros:

Great progressive course structure. You start out with the basics and gradually move into more advanced topics.

The instructors. Each week had numerous lecture videos (each no more than 15 minutes with a majority being less than 10). The material was always relevant to the coding assignments and contained many good coding examples. Greiner's weekly coding tips were always very informative. I write programs for work and was able to use many of his tips there.

Keeping with the instructors, their presentation styles were great. Each video consisted of them talking about a subject with their code in the background, which they would also write in real-time. It's a very effective method of teaching, much better than reading PowerPoint slides verbatim. They're also geeky and fun, and don't try to conceal this in their videos. It really does make learning fun!

The discussion forums were active and a big help. Coding can be difficult at times, but in this class, there were thousands of other people ready to help you. Having your classmates as a resource makes everything a whole lot easier and less stressful. Need some help with a function? Post your question and code snippets in the forum and you'll get a response in under 10 minutes. The instructors also frequented the forums and had a weekly Code Clinic for each week's project. You could submit your code there for specific help from the instructors.

Cons:

None, and I really mean that.

This course was so well put together that it sets a very high standard for other MOOCs. Everything else is going to pale in comparison to what Rixner, Warren, Greiner, and Wong have here.

All in all, definitely take this course. You will learn a lot and will have fun in the process. Even if you're just starting to code, give it a shot; the class offers lots of help at every step!"
20,"completed this course and found the course difficulty to be hard.

CS50 turned out to be precisely what I wanted. The platform is reliable, the UX is crisp, and, most importantly, the course content is phenomenal. Professor David Malan and his army of TAs put an absurd amount of effort into giving Intro to Computer Science actual LIFE. From the first video, it inspired that nervous excitement that always accompanied my setting foot into a lecture hall for the first time. This wasn't YouTube, this was the Real Deal.

Because the course was hard. The homework assignments, which were offered via the same appliance that the live students used and submitted to the same grading tool as well, took me anywhere from four to twelve hours apiece."
21,"This course is extremely efficient in the way it teaches python. I have taken many beginner courses, but none like this where I actually was able to follow along and learn week after week. I felt more and more confident about what I was doing and by the end I felt like I actually grasped Python better than I have in any other beginner course I have taken. The professors take so much time to explain concepts and help their students gain a better understanding of what they are working to learn. I also really appreciated the structure of the course as it allowed me to stay focused and meet deadlines a lot easier. Such a great course for anyone hoping to learn more about Python!"
22,"Overall, a great course!
One of the strengths of this course is its hands-on approach to learning. We were given plenty of opportunities to practice what we have learned through coding exercises and projects.
Overall, this course provides a solid foundation in Python programming that will be useful for anyone interested in pursuing a career in software development or data analysis."
23,"Wonderful course. I come from a background with a familiarity in programming in other languages, and this course was a great refresher and introduction to Python. It was clear how much the instructors cared about the course and their passion for teaching the subject was palpable. I'd recommend to anyone who's interested in getting their feet wet with Python."
24,"It's an excellent course, I love how you can tell how much the professors love what they're doing as they really want you understand every topic. Also, the mini projects are fantastic as they really get you start thinking about the different concepts around each topic. I enjoyed they also provided useful tips to make you a better programmer."
25,"This course covers all the basics to slightly more advanced concepts through fun and well taught classes and mini-projects, which were especially fun to implement. It gives you a good start to Python and I recommend it to anyone who wants to get started/feels like brushing up their basics again. Really fun class, I enjoyed!"
26,"The way how the information is presented is simple and easy to follow even if you don't have any experience, the classes are funny and dynamic that it's because the instructors put a lot of effort to keep it in that way. Thanks to all the instructors to make an awesome course ."
27,"This course was amazing! Joe Warren and Scott Rixner are awesome teachers, and the idea of learning Python thorugh building games makes the projects really exciting! If you are interesting in Python, interactive programming and games, I'd definitely recommend taking this course!"
28,This course is amazing! It's very well organized and the instructors are extremely good! I really appreciate the time and effort they put into this course to make our studying as enjoyable as possible by creating so many funny games for us to develop. Thank you very much!
29,"Thanks to all the people who contribute to this course, it is actually better than most of the code teaching course that I have taken. Special thanks to Joe Warren and Scott Rixnar who made this course so entertaining !"
30,Excelent course. Full of practice projects that really help you find your own path to programming. Also lot of useful information in lessons that guide you through those projects. Very recommendable
31,Very well organized awesome course where I learned a lot. I went from having no idea of GUI programming to a common basic understanding of how things work.
32,"Great course! The professors made the lessons lighthearted and understandable. https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython

They are offering this course again in Spring/Fall 2014 as they said ""The class forums will stay open until the next session starts in late spring. ""

The gaming projects made it fun and left you wanting to add creature features to the base projects. The peers offered some great ideas and resources outside of the class scope of learning/pushing the envelope.



I can't say that I learned the most from this class, being a programmer in other languages already since it was mostly syntactical differences and learning code variances/limitations. But it was the most fun course I have taken. I definitely recommend this class for:

the talented game crowd peers it brings (especially if they are still attending the class after week 6)

I met/followed some peers to an Android development class Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps

for the great professors and lessons for this class

the sense of accomplishment felt when finishing the projects

the basic introductory learning of the Python language in a gaming situation which covers a majority of tasks Canvas UI / Input devices / Math / Program Logic

Dynamic: They provide a minimal project template to get you started on projects which include some core variables and class names and any difficult calculation formulas, images, and sounds to reference but the rest is up to you - it's good fun.

This is an Introduction to Python course this is not an introduction to programming and it happens to be Python coding course. It is not a bad start to programming, they use good OO structure, it just may take several more hours a week to learn fundamental programming concepts. I averaged 10hr week with lectures and assignments."
33,"Overall, this course is truly outstanding in all regards: organization, presentation, quantity of material presented and learned in a limited period of time, and providing useful, reusable game projects completed. I regard it as a paragon of what can be accomplished with on-line instruction. The ""tag-team"" teaching approach was also a significant plus. It provided variety in perspectives as well as an interesting method of partitioning focus. The interleaved lectures and topic mix complemented one another extremely well and provided additional effectiveness in covering the material presented.

CodeSkulptor, an excellent on-line interface tool developed by Professor Rixner, enables students to code interactively in select browsers This tool complemented with online access to variety of course materials made it exceptionally easy and effective to learn, study, review, cross-reference and experiment with the materials presented. Professor Warren's love and knowledge of computer games was impetus for using a graded series of games as class projects and extremely effective vehicles for learning and applying Python. Once completed, these projects not only provided an enjoyable, usable work product, but also provided a basis for continued study, experimentation and extension.

I would recommend this course without qualification to individuals with little or no programming experience to more experienced programmers wanting to expand and sharpen their skills. My only warning is that the 7-9 hours/week is probably a minimum time requirement. To take full advantage of the discussion forums, auxiliary materials and to experiment with variations on the various Python methods and coding options can significantly increase the time required, but this additional time will be well spent."
34,"This 5-week course on Coursera is BRILLIANT! It is well structured with excellent videos, quizzes, practice exercises and mini-projects. You can go from knowing nothing about Python to building some simple, fun games (in guided steps), including mini-projects to build simple versions of Pong, Blackjack, and Asteroids. Your coding is done in a browser-based programming environment called CodeSkulptor (www.codeskulptor.org) developed by one of the Professors that teaches the course. The whole course is 9-weeks long and done in two parts in succession (this one, Part 1 is 5 weeks, then Part 2 is 4 weeks). Do both! The course material is released weekly, that way you don't try and race ahead -- not that most people taking this course really could race ahead, especially when trying to get the programming assignments in on time anyway. Yes, at times I was tearing my hair out, screaming at the screen like that'd get my code to work -- but there are ""programming tips"" and the course discussions forums to help with that, with a lot of input from the Community Teaching Assistants, as well as a ""code clinic"" (for really sick code) and good documentation in CodeSkulptor. Rice's IIPP is the best MOOC I have taken to date. Oh, and the Professors who teach (created) this course deserve awards -- they are truly second to none. Not all MOOCs have such engaging personalities as these teaching them. I learned so much from this course and every moment was a blast, especially clearing my local neighbourhood of asteroids at the end, but I still also have fond memories of the simple console version of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock we created right at the start of the course. I was really quite sad when I completed the course as there were no more mini-projects to tackle!!! I plan to take all of the other courses in this Rice computing specialization as they become available."
35,"the professors at Rice have put together an evenly paced class that leads you through computer science, python language, and GUI concepts. Professors Joe Warren and Scott Rixner deliver the majority of the lectures, so the viewer (me) feels oddly comfortable with their personalities. Joe is a real lover of video games and his lectures focus on game mechanics and logic. Unexpectedly, I learned about physics modelling when there are collisions/reflections in the game; about geometry to capture the radial perimeter of ball/spaceship/asteroid; about game animation. Most importantly are the computer science concepts disguised in each mini-project. Modulo math for decision making in Rock/Paper/Scissors/Lizzard/Spock game; state-transition logic for the Memory game; Bisection search for the Guess the Number; etc. Scott is the mastermind behind http://www.codeskulptor.org/ which is the Python environment used in class, and he is the straight man to Joe's antics. Scott focuses his lectures on code architecture, and you'll learn event-driven modeling, Obect-Oriented (OO), and the simplegui toolkit for CodeSkulptor. Between the two, Joe likes to wear t-shirts and Scott wears ties, and there is always some wager about who'll wear a tie/t-shirt in the current week's mini-project. Joe also wears a themed t-shirt for current week's mini-project. John Greiner is the frequent presenter, and he focuses on debugging and python tricks. Overall, the class progresses with more advance GUI features to complete the final mini-project, RiceRocks (an Asteroids remake). The blackjack project was the most difficult due to the introduction of OO. It is possible to complete this class without prior programming experience since the lectures focus on features to complete the current weeks miniprojects, also the forums visited by generous tips/help."
36,"I am an experimental particle physicist, working mainly in data analysis that involves quite heavy/long C++/python programming and large data processing and management. I have 5+ years of computing experience and skills developed in the field, but I never had a formal training in programming with computer scientists and feel the need to refine my computing skills through some basic-intermediate level online courses on a modern computing language. The highly-praised recommendations from a first search on the web led me to this introductory python course by Rice University at Coursera. I registered after watching their funny and well-designed introduction video that guaranteed me to become ""dangerous"" after completing the course. The past 8-9 weeks I took both Part 1 and 2 of the course. I have to say this is one of the best course I have ever taken (in any field's standard!).

I never really enjoyed programming (though using it at work) nor did I enjoy learning it, but this course gave me a new experience. I had a great time taking it: learning the language formally from the basics and using the simple basics to build on something fun - the projects - they are games I used to play in childhood! I gained more confidence in the language and felt that I would be able to advance further on based on what was taught. Full of appreciation to the professors for all their coherent and persistent efforts in making this course an interesting and inspiring learning experience since the beginning. Their hearts can be felt in many of the details of the course - in *every* part of the course website.

Whether you are a beginner or someone already having some programming experiences and want to pick up the language, check the course out on their website. It will be rewarding."
37,"This course is fantastic; I started as a complete beginner to programming and it was really fun to be able to create a game at the end of each week (albeit non-interactive the first week - but understandably so!).

I admit I was nervous initially, when I saw all the ""Introduce yourself"" posts on the forum, where many people referred to many years of experience in other programming languages. Yes, I probably needed to spend some more hours each week at it than others in the class, but it was really rewarding to get the program working at the end of each week, and possibly adding some embellishments once finished!

Some weeks were easier than others, but there was a really supportive community active on the forums, with fellow students offering each other advice and support, as well as community TAs adding extra help, and the course lecturers monitoring the forums to assist, so there was always help if needed. They'd also set up a ""code clinic"" if you were really stuck in spite of all the other help available, but fortunately I never had to use it!

Overall, the lecturers did a great job of putting the course together, structured in such a way as to create foundations and add building blocks, and making it functional by using the information to create new games each week, and they did this all with a sense of fun and humour, which made it a really enjoyable class. Many thanks to Scott Rixner, Joe Warren, John Greiner and Stephen Wong who put the course together and all the amazing materials. I have a lot to learn but now I'm starting from a great place, and really looking forward to more programming! Would definitely recommend this course :)"
38,"This was a great course on introductory programming! I honestly wish some of my college courses were as well constructed. Every part of it worked together to teach new concepts without forgetting to reinforce and extent the older ones. All the videos were direct and on-point for the concepts you'd need for the week's project; the quizzes kept you very honest about your class video watching and highlighted the finer points of the concepts you'd need for the big homework project for the week. The focus on making those projects small games of increasing complexity but simple game play was spot-on too - both fun and rewarding on a regular basis. Even the grading scheme - where you run through several of your classmates' assignments and grade to criteria, was a clever way to have group participation without the typical problems of group work. And the CodeSculptor web-based Python development environment eliminated just about all the computer/OS specific problems. WELL DONE!!

One thing that seemed to be a negative was the work depended on the SimpleGUI libraries, which are not otherwise available outside CodeSkulptor which leaves your games stuck there - but since then I've read about SimpleGUICS2Pygame which should help in breaking your games free.

Also, while it is not meant as a comprehensive course on Python, it seemed that some concepts were too quickly introduced and put to use before understanding them and why they exist - Classes/OOP stands out. Also, sooo much dad humor...

But - for an introduction - my appetite is whet, and I'm off to see what else is out there. Well done to Joe, Rick, John, Stephen and Rice on University for making a great MOOC."
39,"Wow, what a great course. I am 66, began programming in Basic at Dartmouth in 1967, continued on learning Cobol and Fortran for business (with punch cards) and finished up at Harvard with Pascal. I haven't worked in what we called MIS since 1987, so while I knew of object-oriented programming, I never quite understood how or why one would use it. I also had no real interest in gaming. A young college graduate friend toying with idea of game development as a career asked me my advice. I suggested that I would find an online course and we would take it together and he could find out if it was something that might work for him. He dropped out after part 1 ( he had a life), but I was hooked and continued.
Far and away the most organized class I have ever taken. The lectures, quizzes and mini-projects built on one another beautifully. Everything was there to complete the projects---and on several occasions I even went to the forum for some hints. Not as much fun as helping a young woman after class at a coffee house, but more effective. In particular, your roadmaps for attacking the mini-projects were invaluable. I couldn't have completed the projects without them. Also, telling us which data structure to use saved a lot of time and pain. Those decisions are often more important than the actual programming. I admit, I probably spent about 15 hours a week on the course, and without the lure of a grade or a paycheck, it was sometimes challenging. But I am terribly pleased and impressed with my final project. I wish I had friends that would appreciate what I have done."
40,"Course was excellent. My first MOOC experience and I suspect they set a very high bar. I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone interested in learning to code.

I was impressed by the organization and thought that had obviously gone into preparing this course. The class lectures are split up into bite size pieces (5 – 15 min) and come with example code. The quizzes and deadlines helped keep me on track. Between the lectures, examples, and project templates, we were given a lot of support to keep the experience from becoming overwhelming. The miniprojects were challenging and sometimes took me longer than I planned, but whenever I got stuck there was always a tip or a discussion thread to help me break through.

The instructors, particularly Joe Warren and Scott Rixner, clearly love what they do. I appreciated their efforts to inject humor and fun into the videos. It makes you feel like you get to know them over the course.

I had tried to learn a different computer language previously using a book and never really got anywhere. This course moves you along and the projects get you used to using different aspects of the code. The material keeps you engaged and there really is nothing like the sense of accomplishment that comes from getting a program to work.

I took this course with no prior knowledge of Python (and my previous programming was ancient history – BASIC in high school, COBAL in college, all forgotten). I did it nights and weekends while working a full time job. Was a bit pressed for time here and there, but made it through."
41,The class was fun and instructive. It made me comfortable programming in python and showed me ways to enjoy programming and to be creative while doing so
42,"The course was great and i have learned a lot from it, which was very interesting and also innovative."
43,"It is a great course. I really liked the thing that everything is online and all the tools for the course are provided, so it has been made as comfortable as possible for student to be learning. Thank you for the course!"
44,"An Introduction to Interactive Python (Part I and Part II) is easily one of the best Introductory Python classes on Coursera. But unlike some other courses, this one is definitely challenging. It was pretty easy for me for the first few weeks, but later on you are going to have to put in some work and time. The programs can take hours, but I feel they are worth it as the end product is satisfying and useful.
So if you are serious and committed, and can spend a reasonable amount of time, you should definitely take this class. It is in true sense a Programming course"
45,"This is a great introduction to Python, but it can be very overwhelming due to its fast pace. I'd highly recommend this course if you have at least some knowledge of computer science. If you're completely new to computers, this class will become very difficult very quickly.

The instructors were excellent, informative, and entertaining. I look forward to taking the other classes in their series."
46,"What I loved about this class is that you can tell how passionate Scott, Joe and John are. They really managed to engage me into learning and trying to overcome obstacles, and honestly I would have loved to be their student in ""real life"" and not just in a virtual course. They are great teachers, the content of the course is well organized, resources are plenty, exercises are really challenging and good for really understanding what was explained in the videos.
All in all, 5 start teachers, a 5 star course.
Thank you for the time you invested in this."
47,"I had no programming experience, but was interested to learn python to help sharpen my skills in my current profession. The classes were great and I can't wait to apply my newly acquired knowledge to new projects in my work. :)"
48,"Great course! I really recommend it to all of you! I had a lot of fun. Tasks were not difficult but really interesting and effective! You'll have to use Python 2, but this course there was almost no difference from Python 3. Good luck!"
49,"It was great! I was very excited to take the course, and it didn't disappoint. The instructors are great and the class was well organized. Overall, an amazing course and I recommend all beginners to take it as well"
50,"This is a fantastic class for jumping into programming for the first time and hitting the ground running. The projects are fun and you can learn a lot working on them and actually use them when you're finished. Hopefully they will transition the class to using Python 3, but as of August 2022, it's still using Python 2 by default (although you can explicitly use 3 by changing the url to CodeSkulptor.) Overall I really enjoyed this class!"
51,"Best ever course of Python. They are excellent teachers and everything is perfectly well implemented in CodeSkulptor so it's easy to share your code and programs with other students or people. The program of this course is quite challenging, learning deep usage of many Python classes as well ass Object Oriented Programing, while having fun designing your own working games!"
52,"I really liked learning Python in this course and applying it in a variety of interesting games/applications.
First of all, I truly appreciate an effort of the professors who led it and their genuine charisma, that can only be present whenever someone is doing what he/she enjoys. They kept it funny, entertaining and motivating to go until the end of the course.
Also I think that CodeSkulptor and an emphasis on interactivity is what made this course very beginner-friendly and facilitating in getting hands on the fundamentals of programming without freaking out over some ugly console - UI and an unfamiliar environment.
I know what I am talking about from my own experience: I tried to take my very first programming course in C++, when I was 15 y.o. And that experience traumatized me so badly that only 10 years later had I found a will to try it again."
53,"I think this course makes programming very accessible to people with little to no prior knowledge to programming at all. Personally I've had a tiny bit of prior experience from studying computer science in high school, mostly in C and a small bit in Assembler so I did have a small bit of prior knowledge.

Still I couldn't really write any meaningful programs just from my high school knowledge, whereas now after this course I have a solid toolbox to begin programming with. Also the weekly projects of the course were in and of themselves meaningful, such as programming the games: pong, memory and blackjack(albeit with simplistic rules) that I can now take and expand on to make them better with the knowledge of the entire course under my belt now.

Moreover I can envision how various popular games that I like playing were created, at least the programming portions of them(not the graphics, animations, etc), and think I have the tools to write similar games. I might not be able to write them in the most efficient way as I still lack programming experience but it's at least I can create a working code to achieve the same results. Higher efficiency will naturally come with experience."
54,"I'm a professional linux engineer with 20+ years of experience in Unix environments. I have used programming languages since the beginning but wanted to learn python as some of my expert shell knowledge can't deliver what python can.

This course was excellent. And challenging. I had already taken a Python CBT from cbtnuggets, and I have 3 python reference books. I was able to get through the entire course without referring to outside resources except for maybe two questions. They provide enough guidance if you have some background to get through the course, but at the same time, as an introduction, it is not light-weight. I struggled to get the final project completed on time with my busy schedule, but still was able to accomplish it.

The hands-on learning is impressive. There platform made for a very consistent learning experience without the need to load your own code on your computer. The web based development platform is one of the best I have used. Props to you Scott.

It would have been helpful if this course could have covered a few items a bit more thoroughly and have been extended a few weeks more. But for the duration, the pace was just about right for a busy person."
55,"A very polished and well taught class. The teachers are friendly and helpful and provide you with everything you need to know to finish the course and learn the basics of Python. They also manage to make the course fun and engaging. The only reason I did not give this class five stars is that at no point did I feel particularly challenged by this course. This does have it's benefits. Firstly I believe this makes this course very accessible (also, the active forums and 'code clinics' are good for helping people who get stuck). However, although the mini-project assignments were all very fun, I felt like there was maybe a little too much hand-holding for my tastes, with very formulaic instructions which almost lead me to think that I'm just doing someone else's work. I'm maybe being harsh, this setup allows them to teach their students a very optimal style of coding, and for a massive online course with potentially thousands of students, taking an approach which allows for more student creativity (which would lead to students possibly learning bad coding habits and making mistakes on a scale at which the teachers would not be able to correct) may be difficult.

All in all it's a good, fun MOOC which provides a very solid base for learning to code. I feel harsh for the four stars as I think they're pretty much doing the best possible given the limitations of MOOCs, but I'm going to stick with it. If you're an absolute beginner in coding, this course is right for you."
56,"You would be hard-pressed to find an Introduction to the python programming as lucid and as fun as this course. Personally , I took this course to practice python programming as I had a bit of programming experience in my first sem of college. But , I must say I wish I had taken this course earlier ie. as a complete beginner. The approach followed by the professors is ""Just in Time"" and not flooding the lectures with as much info as they can.

The highlight of the course are ofcourse the Games that you get to make using SimpleGui. ( My personal favourite is the Black Jack - taught me a great deal of things about OOPS). After completing both IIPP-1 and IIPP-2 I now feel a lot more comfortable while reading other people's code. So, all in all even though you will be making games here, the skills you learn will be applicable everywhere.

One thing I was worried about before taking this class was that it is in Python 2. I can assure you this won't be a problem as-

The only difference you will notice in Python 3 is that print is a function now and / is used a little differently that's all.

For advanced and semi-advanced people this course may be a bit dull just like any Introduction Course. But for beginners and those who are not yet comfortable in writing long lines of code this course is simply one of the best.

At last, I would like to Thank all the 4 professors to create this gem."
57,"This is an excellent course, and I highly recommend it to ANYONE that wants to learn Python or just get better at Python programming. It covers Python from the ground up. I’ve programmed in Python for several years and still learned a lot. I particularly appreciated the part on OOP (object-oriented programming). It is something that I used before, but did not really understand until I took this course.

You learn Python by building games using a web-based version of Python developed specifically for the course called CodeSkulptor. At first, I wasn’t sure about using CodeSkulptor, but it was a good choice. It removes the struggle of just trying to get Python to work on your machine that can wear you out before you even begin. Building the games was fun, and when you get a game to work correctly, you want to do backflips.

They also have a Code Clinic where you can send your code when you are having problems. I used it a couple of times and found it invaluable. They responded quickly and were very helpful."
58,"This class was a a truly outstanding experience that has single-handedly changed my opinion of MOOCs, and online education in general. I have a class I honours degree, as well as a various industry certifications and qualifications I've accumulated over the years, yet I can genuinely say that this class has been the best eight weeks of education I have ever experienced. Throughout it has been obvious that the syllabus, the course structure, the delivery methods, and the continuous engagement, all reflected many hours of careful thought, planning, and effort. I always felt the focus was clear, the right knowledge being presented at the right moment, and support was available if needed. By the end of the last project I really did feel almost as though I was 'standing on the shoulders of giants' - and surely that is the best complement any student could ever give.

I will keeping my eyes peeled on coursera in future for the names Joe, Scott, and John. I hope I might one day be able to take a class of this quality again"
59,"Awesome class! I just completed the course and highly recommend it.

I had minimal programming experience coming into this 2-part course and I managed to successfully complete all of the projects and quizzes. The projects are cool too: you build games like Memory, Blackjack, and Asteroids (called RiceRocks in the course) as a way of teaching you how to program in Python. As a beginner, the projects took me a long time, but with guidance from the profs and teaching assistants, it's definitely manageable. The instructors did a great job of introducing concepts and programming methods, providing practice exercises, and ultimately challenging students with a project that puts these new tools to use. They're funny, too.
I want to take more classes taught by Joe and Scott. Highly recommend this course."
60,"F-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c class!

I have almost 20 years of programming in different languages and I wanted to let my 16 year old son feel what it is to ""create software"" and how much fun it can be. So we both subscribed for this class.

And man, it was really fun for both of us.

I admit that if you've never programmed before - like my son - it was sometimes tough. But he told me that he found it great to learn about the basics of the games he likes to play and what it takes to create them. He also appreciated the fact that you had a weekly deadline to end your mini-projects. That way you just have to go for it.

It was my first class @ Coursera and I'm already looking out for another one to follow. So obviously, the friendly and dedicated professors at Rice did a GREAT job!

Highly recommended class."
61,The course really excites me and offers me the enthusiasm to learn programming as a beginner. I think it's a fantastic idea that we could learn the skills and concepts of python through making lots of interesting interactive games. I have not expected this kind of valuable experience!
62,I am very grateful for all your teachings. Thank you so much. I am sorry I can not tell you more about the class. They (two parts) are both very awesome. You paved the way for me to learn python. I hope I can be a good bioinformatician and contribute to making our world better.
63,"Great course. Instructors work really hard to make the course fun and the concept of coding games makes it a unique way to learn to code. You can share your code with friends and even if they have no coding knowledge, they can enjoy the games you have created. As a result, you get a lot more out of your hard work. The tools available are also great, with discussions forums and the setup is nice. As a very new coder, I found this course a challenge. I'd just say be aware that if you are completely new, you will likely sink a lot of hours into the code and probably struggle but you can do it with the tools provided. If you are willing to put in the work, you will get there and feel a real sense of achievement on completion."
64,"While the professors were fun and all, I think if you have some difficulties in mathematics (just like I do), you will have a hard time in this course after week 2 or 3. It's just that the difficulty of the course is not that linear the jump from Week 3 and beyond is just too high for me (high enough that I decided to not follow the course schedule and just do the course in my own pace.) if the professor would ever read this I think that's one of the things to consider if you ever offer this course in the future.

Other than that I believe that the professors were great educators. but if you have difficulties in mathematics, maybe you should brush up a little on it before diving into this course head on."
65,"Very nice introduction to Python programming; the material is very well designed, with progressive difficulty. Projects are not easy but not too difficult, just at the right level : it requires work, but they are funny, and instructors give you lot of tips, helping you to achieve the assignments step by step. Of course you can find most of the solutions on Google, but with help of tips and forums, you can do it by yourself, which is much more rewarding. Definitely the best course i took on introduction to Python. It is however useful to have some familiarity with computer and IT, and a basic previous experience in programming (any language)"
66,I love this course
67,"As an absolute beginner in programming I found the course hard. They walked you trough the assignments but never gave anything away easy. You have to work for it. I ended up programming very nice games in 9 weeks starting with knowing nothing about programming.

The course is really structured and the assignments are very clear. The codeskulptor website and the codeclinic where they help you with 'sick' code are organised well. I got a reaction from one of the instructors fast and that helps a lot.

The game-part of it makes it a lot more fun and seeing the instructors play takes a bit of seriousness away and shows programming can be lots of fun. I've learned enough to be dangerous and I am very proud of it."
68,"I recently graduated from college with a BS in Computer Science, strangely enough I did not take any Python courses because basically there were no classes that taught it. After graduation I decided to learn it, I learned about Coursera while watching CNN. I enrolled in this class to give it a try, and I could not be more satisfied with course. I cannot thank enough Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen for putting together this great course. I imagine the great amount of time that these professors had to put to get it going. I must say that I really enjoyed the topics covered, the teaching styles, and the guidance throughout these 8 weeks. I'd highly recommend this course for all those folks who want to learn Python."
69,Content of the course was very fun and rewarding. The instructors made clear videos and were committed to providing a great course for beginners. Making the games as a part of this class was great.
70,"Well taught, well structured, terrific and humorous teachers, I learned a ton and I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn Python and coding fundamentals. Awesome."
71,ITS BEEN A GREAT JOURNEY WITH AN INTRODUCTION TO INTERACTIVE LEARNING IN PYTHON WHICH IS OFFERED BY COURSERA...LEARNT MANY NEW THINGS...HOPE IT WILL HELP ME IN MY LONG RUN
72,"I think this course is fantastic because it joins the learning of the Python language , the basics of the object oriented programming and event driven software principles."
73,"A very good course. In thie course, the teachers gave very impressive content and organize the content in a understandable way. Thanks very much for the course."
74,It is very very good course and with excellent teachers . It is very helpful for programming learner. And also very helpful for future job references
75,"I am 44 years old and even if I had a hard time warming up my neurons, I really was able to do it because of the good design and guidance. Thank you!"
76,"I have learned a lot of courses about Python, but none of them is as amazing like this. You can even build a game within 2 weeks!"
77,Your review helps other learners like you discover great courses. Only review the course if you have taken or started taking this course
78,"Great class run by excellent instructors, Joe Warren and Scott Rixner with help from their friends! I would also commend RIce University as well for the leadership in this new online learning space.

The class was challenging, even for folks with programming experience, but with the level of assistance from the instructors and other students, quite doable for anyone with a bit of programming background.

It provided an excellent grounding in interactive game programming and the python language, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in either topic...

The nice thing about these courses is that they force you to learn, practice and code in real time, which you might might not otherwise be able to do without the course environment.

I'm definitely looking forward to the next course by Joe and Scott!"
79,"I've been coding for a year and a half and in a job for six months of that time, before enrolling for this class. This one serioisly made me feel like I should've started with this. I would've accomplished lot more in less time.

This class starts with introducing a student to Python programming language and later digs deep into computer science fundamentals. Even while teaching Python, the challenges they give are not too difficult to demotivate a student and not too easy to mislead student into thinking that they've learnt all.

Each and every mini project builds on the concepts taught in its past week. Watching lectures and doing practice exercises is not enough. One should go back and revise, refer to the documentation to feel comfortable at solving the mini projects. Otherwise it is easy that a student might get overwhelmed by the mini projects.

After completing first couple of courses in the Fundamentals of Computing specialization, I came to know that this is a very constructive way of learning."
80,"I am a self-taught engineer who uses python a fair amount, but wanted to get more familiar with specific details of the language. This course comprises the first 2 courses of a Python specialization offered by Rice University on Coursera. It exposes students to the notion of classes and object oriented programming, as well as Python game development. The course uses a GUI developed at Rice University, so one would need to alter codes to run them on other platforms. The GUI came with a really nice visualization mode that illustrates how variables are updated and inter-related at various stages of code execution. The course was very informative and extremely well organized. All 3 instructors were easy to follow and understand. Each lecture discussed specific techniques and/or concepts that would be used in that week's coding assignment. Overall, a worthwhile course, especially if you are looking for an introduction to Python game design."
81,"This is the best online class I've ever taken. I haven't been able to stop talking about it to anyone who will listen for the last 8 weeks. I'm actually sad that it's over. The structure of the course allowed for a very engaging and productive experience. The assignments were very well designed, and I actually looked forward to completing all of them. I already had experience with Python prior to taking this course, but I still learned many new things and found the material to be challenging (in a good way)."
82,Amazing experience with you. I enjoyed a lot to take this course. Wish you all the best and hope to see you in future
83,"this was a great class I really enjoyed it, the teachers were great and the content was really organized"
84,"Whether you already have some programming experience in another language and want to learn Python, or if you have no experience at all and want to dive into programming, I would highly recommend taking this course. The material covered is extensive but not too complex, so it is a great primer into programming in Python, and leaves you at a comfortable point to be able to expand your knowledge and skills independently. The instructors are great. They are knowledgeable, eloquent, helpful and fun. The course is organized well and includes lots of resources to help you through to completion and beyond."
85,"This is the best online class I've ever taken. The programming environment provided by the instructors makes it easy to get up and running and stay that way. Lessons progress in a gradual, logical way so that each one builds on the one before it. The different teaching methods - videos, text, assignments, quizzes, and peer reviews - all work together to reinforce the concepts you learn in each unit. I fell that I have a solid understanding of the basics of python and I'm ready to explore on my own. I highly recommend this class."
86,"It has been a fun and addictive course for me, given that i just have started programming. Though the contents is great in term of their potential applications in real world problems I would advice to keep, some other free and open source sites, handy, for basics & intermediate python. Because there is not much explanations of them in this course and it would be stupid to not take this course just because of this reason"
87,"I think this is a great course for beginning at programming. You get to do really interesting things from scratch in just two months. They teach in a way that you always are capable of achieving the objectives if you use time enough.

If you already know programming you can get bored sometime at the beginning, but I think you finally learn valuable things from the midterm to the end, like event-oriented programming, graphical issues about games and, of course, Python and object-oriented programming.

It's been a pleasure."
88,This class really teaches me programming skills and techniques in a fun way! The mini-projects are so fun and well-designed to let you implement what you have learned in that week. I was literally obsessed with this class and finished it within a month! Strongly recommended this class for programming beginners. The instructors made the content of this class so comprehensive yet easy to follow.
89,"Excellent class for learning how to program in Python. Introduces basic programming concepts in the context of creating increasingly complex games. Each week of class includes a graded ""mini-project"" but also includes optional exercises (with solutions if you get stuck) to help students master the material. Especially in the later weeks, I highly recommend taking the time to do these exercises."
90,"Good & entertaining introduction to Python. Great online help from both fellow-students and class-staff. Quick responses help you out when you get stuck (and I got stuck quite a few times as a beginning programmer). Last resort is an e-mail ""hotline"" that I needed for the end project, great thing that they provided this. Coursera to me is a great learning-platform because of the deadlines, the simultanious learning with a large community and the variation in learning material: videos, quizzes and projects."
91,"Truly an amazing experience. Takes you on a journey, assuming, you are a complete beginner to a stage where you become more than enough independent so that you can learn more and delve deeper into the realm of programming. Mini projects are amazing, not too easy not too hard, and sense of accomplishment you get after completing it is enormous and extremely motivational. Loved it!"
92,"This course is truly inspiring! It's my first course on Python, and it meets all my expectations. I especially enjoy working on the mini projects -- all of them are basically games, so I got to play with the program I wrote, which is extremely fun and gives me a great sense of fulfilment. Most importantly, the instructors are all great. The forum is helpful too."
93,"This is an excellent course, the teachers are skilled, while the course material is very well-organized. The level of guidance for the assignments is just right for a beginner course. Humor is present throughout the course - which is a good motivator - and references to all-time classics like: Monty Python's Flying Circus and The Big Bang Theory are nice bonuses."
94,"This course was just AMAZING like its instructors, I enjoyed watching every moment of it and learning through it. I couldn't code, even one line! But I first start with their other introduction to python programing and then continued with this one and learned many new things as well as coding fun games. You should definitely give it a shot!"
95,"This class is FUN, but can be hard work at times. However, it is always satisfying when you find a solution that works.

I've been on similar courses where I've not learnt nearly as much and are somewhat dull and dry in comparison.

The teaching is ""what is required at the time"", well presented and both the lecturers and the student community are very supportive and helpful.

I can't recommend it enough.

But most of all its FUN!"
96,"An extremely fun, informative, and inspiring course delivered with great passion and a dash of panache. It's extremely heartening to see my own progression from a simple rock paper scissors riff at the start to a full-fledged Asteroids implementation by the end. Thanks Joe, Scott, John and Stephen!"
97,"Amazing course. You can take this course even if you have 0 knowledge about programming. Professors are professionals. They teach step by step in simple language. And by the end of the course you will feel proud of yourself because you've done many interesting projects and built games, YES GAMES :)"
98,"I really enjoyed this class. I tried to learn Python a few times before this, but this is the only time I get to really write code instead of just learning concepts. It reminded me of learning stuff at school, where you don't have to worry about making mistakes and you can always learn from the mistakes with an instructor telling you where you went wrong. I didn't really get many instructions but the course was designed in a way that predicted most of your questions. It is a really rare experience when you are an adult and are trying to learn something new. I had worries that simplegui is not a popular library and what if the learning ended up being useless. I will see if it's useful in my future study but right now I just want to thank the teachers to make me feel like I can actually do this and have the confidence to learn more about coding."
99,"This course is marvelous! You build a game per week!

Anyone wanting to enter the world of programming - a knowledge that will be like a bread counterpart in everyone's tech life from here and beyond the future - should take this class: you will feel like doing great things from the start and start building games once per week!

It's very common to many introductory CS courses not starting to teach graphics programming that helps you build games or softwares with a Graphics User Interface (GUI), making the students feel like that is not for them or that programming is too complicated or for scientists only. This course proves that to be wrong!

Well.. While it is true that programming can be complicated, it also can not. Most of the time, you won't need to think about computer resources or anything like that to build games or develop utilities - just you imagination and the very basic of programming in any language (in this case, Python - a simple programming language, yet powerful). The tools used to build games weekly are very beginner friendly and let you grasp what it is like to build a little more sophisticated games. It really works well for anyone that wants to learn; just watch the videos and try typing the code!

As a plus,students from all over the world you help you, as well the instructors! You can also get a certificate.

I really recommend this course for beginners. More advanced programmers can also do it for certificates or to learn python in a 'slowed' way for them - great for hard works!"
100,"The content was well prepared, delivered with enthusiasm and personality and somehow managed to be engaging and worthwhile yet accessible to the huge breadth of learner experience watching. Remarks made were clear to beginners yet concise and succinct enough for refresher students too. e.g. in my case learning Python GUI from a background of compiled languages.

The instructor team are clearly committed to making this a positive, useful, empowering and beneficial experience for *every* learner. They clearly want everyone to succeed. And to that end they've clearly invested much time in developing and polishing this 4/5th iteration of this course. When you add to that their boundless enthusiasm, Python-esque zany humour (and choice of t-shirts and ties), the team really does ""give it all"" for the thousands of students taking this course.

As to RICE University, I can only congratulate them for their insight that developing solid MOOC offerings is time well spent and this course is an excellent example of what can be done migrating classroom experience to the global MOOC platform. Well done supporting your own people and in turn potentially hundreds of thousands of future learners.

As an experienced software developer who took a long career diversion into first aid and emergency care, this has been an enjoyable and productive way to get my head back into Computer science and coding, as well as apply that knowledge in a fun way - that of building well known graphical games. Many Thanks to the RICE CS Team!!!"
101,"For a non-programmer, there could not be a better or more interesting Python MOOC. Very empathetic instructors, entertaining and interesting videos and material, highly professional structure with forums, TAs, code clinic, etc. The special Python environment ""Codeskulptor' takes away fear as it takes all setting up issues away and allows you to achieve amazing results in the forms of cool games.

This really seems to be the stand-out Python MOOC."
102,I took a cource for learning python programming on udemy and I like that cource every student should take some cource for their future and I want to make a project on game and robot so I took that cource and you will get certificate from that cource
103,"Wonderful course. I learned a lot. I liked how the content was structured from simple to complex. The practice, the quiz, and the projects really helped to apply and test the knowledge gained through the course and videos, and helped to build confidence."
104,I really enjoyed this course. I have taken multiple programming courses but this one was by far the most unique one. It really gets you to think and approach problems in new ways. I'd highly recommend this course to beginners in programming.
105,"Very informative and useful class. Also made more fun by the fact that we were building games , and who doesnt love games! All the teachers were knowledgeable and articulate so credit to them for putting this course together."
106,"I thought this was a very good introductory course in programming for a beginner. The exercises were sequential, easy to follow, and I never felt stranded--it was a manageable hop from one project to the next. Good job"
107,"A very well-presented course providing an introduction to programming, using Python as the language. They have created a fantastic online interactive Python programming environment which provides a basic GUI library to get a beginner involved with fun projects with visible results. For experienced programmers, this is a good, but simple, introduction to the Python language."
108,"Loved the course, the teachers succeed in making the learning process fun and engaging, I think I can say for sure that I've learned a lot from it and never felt discouraged or stuck for a long time"
109,Excellent course. Very personable instructors. I had never programmed in Python before but found the course easy to understand and I had success in each project.
110,"This course is an amazing resource to learn python. The process of learning is very kindly, and teachers got very polished and successful videos, quizzes and projects."
111,Very good instructors! Very good course-content! I absolutely reccomend this course to anyone with an interest in game programming and programming in general!
112,"If you are a new guy in program, this course is a good way to learn Python. Teachers pay a lot attention in this class, that make it works more smooth!"
113,Instructors and videos are good. It's a bit of a ghost town trying to get projects reviewed and even finding projects to review.
114,"Imagine the time when you were standing in front of a x-mas tree and your parents said to you look under the tree whether you got something. After holding the present in hand, your eyes started to be shiny and happiness went through your whole body. In this class two of those kids who grew into Ivy League professors infect you with Obsession, Joy and the will to win. You will learn a solid basis to programm in python. You will enjoy it to watch the videos and listen to perfectly structured lectures created in long evenings to fulfil a wish. Python makes you build games and you will talk Python after this course. You will get what you need to be successful to start creating tools out of electrons. I enjoyed this course very much! Programming can be done by everybody! The exercices are graded by peer review which is a good learning experience. I deliberately tried to send something not so perfect as a solution to experience the downgrading process by other people. I somehow was disappointed! To revise somebody´s work should imply to give him proposals how to solve his problems!!! This is the only point where i critizize a little bit. Hey you (girl or boy), gaming is out there and after trying it, everybody is becoming a nerd although everybody is sceptical in the beginning. Somehow many people share this fascination and building games even increases your joy for gaming!!! Try this course it will be a mind blowing experience!!! ;-)"
115,"TLDR: This course was great. If you have little Python experience and/or want to get into coding, put everything aside and do it!

Prior knowledge:
I had some basic exposure to the Python programming language and a decent amount of programming knowledge in general.

Content:
The course will teach you the basics in Python: lists, dictionaries, functions, sets, etc. You will apply these concepts by doing exercise and programming assignments each week. The assignments are usually cool games which you can showcase on your github or play with friends :).

Teaching Style:
One of the main reasons I was kept motivated throughout the course was the instructors. Joe Warren and Scott RIxner are excellent teachers. They really do want to make their students learn stuff and do not just read from slides, like in other courses (*cough* Python for everybode *cough*). They are enthusiastic about the lecture material as well as motivated to teach you something. But most important of all: they never take them too seriously making the students engaged throughout the course. Their engaging teaching style as well as the ""bro""-atmosphere throughout the course gave me a huge nerd-crush and made me actually continue with their spezialization.

Drawbacks:
The only problem may be the reliance on Codeskulptor which can be quite stubborn from time to time. Discussion forums are sometimes dead and feedback on your code from peer review will be quite sparse."
116,"This two-semester course has been invaluable to me in kick-starting my education in the Python programming language. Each semester is broken into about 4 weeks each and uses the web-based tool that professor Scott Rixner created especially for this class. The professors have not only done a wonderful job teaching in their many videos, but their many teaching resources work well on the Coursera platform and interface, and their written resources can give additional help and assistance when you are reaching a stuck spot in the mini projects. What I truly loved about this class was how fun and easy it was to get through each week, seeing as how I usually only spent a cumulative 6-8 hours to get through each week's course content. Given how much of an impression these courses have given me and the versatility and power which a good coding skill set can provide you, I wish to take the other five courses offered by the coding professors of Rice University (also featured on the Coursera website). These include four higher-level classes and a final capstone project. I hope that finishing these classes and fulfilling the capstone requirements will help me become credentialed in the Python programming language.
I also hope that you will enjoy the class as well.
P.S. If you are in China or plan on going to China and wish to take this class, you will need a VPN (I used ExpressVPN) in order to access the class and Coursera webpages and materials."
117,"Truly enjoyed this class.

One of the old school students who has been out in the workforce for 30+ years. Went into management for a while and got rusty. Now trying to get back into hands on, bytes under the fingernails. Was looking for an online course around this ""Python"" language I kept running into (plus I am an original Python fan, to date me). This seemed like a good idea and I could take it until I got bored or overwhelmed and nobody would know.

Well, I got hooked, thanks to the interesting material and the excellent instruction by Joe, Scott, and John. Used to program in C++, so I had an object oriented background which helped. The course does a jump from sequential programming to OOP required for game development, which I think knocked a few neophytes out of the running.

The IDE, if I can call it that, CodeSkulptor was interesting and handy to code in. Understand the decision to go with this, but in the end, I have to migrate my knowledge back into a more mainstream IDE such as Eclipse. IDE's are great, but my biggest need is a good debugger which is not available in CokeSkulptor. This did tend to extend the programming assignments when sprites did not draw due to out of bounds conditions. Became more trial and error.

However, in the end, I can give nothing but praise for this course. Looked forward to it each week and sad I have to get back to the real world. Two thumbs up."
118,"This was a great set of classes. I'd recommend this class to anyone at any level of programming experience who wants to get a good introduction to Python.

I have over 30 years of development experience, but have never coded Python before. Even though this class was geared to student with little to no programming experience, the programming assignments and quizzes were still challenging enough to keep me busy on the weekends :)

Fortunately, the class was a also lot of fun. Spending hours doing game development is a lot more fun than building esoteric applications. It's also more rewarding to play games that you've built yourself, rather than something you just downloaded from the web.

I also can't speak highly enough of the class curriculum, the instructors, and the individual course content. Usually, each week's lectures and the explanation of the accompanying project assignment would be split among the 3 main instructors, each providing a different area of focus and expertise - Python Language, Data Structures, Game Mechanics , Best Practices, and Debugging. I think the delegation of these tasks made the class more interesting, since it allowed each instructor to focus on part of the course they were most enthusiastic about teaching. The best part was that you could tell that the instructors (at least 2 of them :) ) had fun teaching these classes!"
119,"This was an outstanding class, and I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in learning the basics of programming in Python. The profs were knowledgeable and entertaining, and the fact that every project was, or was turned into, a game, kept the course, and the peer assessments, very engaging.

While this class did wind up taking more time than I had originally anticipated, that was probably due mostly to the fact that I tried to improve on every project we were assigned, finishing it to spec, and then seeing how much I could add to it without taking away from the playability. Some weeks I only got the minimum requirements done on time, while other weeks I was able to get fairly ridiculous. But even if I came across a stumbling block outside of the official grading rubric, the pros were very happy to help out. Their involvement in the forums and the code clinic (a group designed to give specific help to those who needed it) was outstanding. I was actually sort of amazed at how much input they had. I mean, I know these guys have day jobs.

To sum up, I think that this is a great class; amazing, really, when you consider it was their first attempt at a MOOC. There were a few minor issues, but they were addressed in the wrap-up video, and look like they will be addressed by the time they offer this class again in the spring."
120,"I took both parts and the class was fun and well taught. In addition to learning Python it also taught you about how to program well and how to code well. Through the course they introduced new concepts that allowed the programmer to evolve to new and better coding techniques, and the exercises (which are optional but I highly recommend) and assignments demonstrated how to break down a problem to its smallest parts and build the code piece by piece. The code technique sections and visual debug process really helped show how the code work - and led to a deeper understanding of concepts like references versus copies of data objects. The friendly competition between the professors made the videos fun to watch, and the peer review taught a lot about coding just from seeing how others solved the same problem. I highly recommend this class, even for someone who has coded before but is just switching to python - you may even learn some better ways to code for all languages, and for the beginner I also recommend it. A friend of mine was stuck on a python assignment for class and I used the techniques I learned in this class, such as breaking down the problem and solving the simple problem first and then building on top of it, to help them see what they needed to do for their code. A great class for anyone wanting to learn python."
121,Very well structured. I was able to complete all assignements without getting too frustrated. Really well thought through.
122,I've learnt a lot with this course. I hardly recommended to all the begginers in Python. It's very good and also very funny.
123,"I had only self-study knowledge of Python prior to this course, and appreciated having a structured approach to it. The instructors are funny and engaging and I believe explain things well for the most part. The projects are fun and the games-based focus provides motivation to get things working. One caveat, however, is that even though most of my programming knowledge is informal, I have prior programming experience so I don't know how it would have been to enter this course with a completely blank slate."
124,Loved the course and will miss the instructors. They were funny and made the material very accessible. I'd never encountered object oriented programming before and have gained a new appreciation for it! I'll definitely be taking more courses run by Rice.
125,Very informative and useful course for all the python begineers . learnt basic python and coding process
126,"I was reading books about Python for months now, but what I learned with this class is gonna stay forever in my mind. Throughout my life, from elementary school, high school, and even University, I saw a handful of teachers who made a mark in my mind. And these fine gentlemen, even if far away, that I personally did not meet, left me with immense joy, an ever-growing interest, and passion to continue my journey on learning how to code. Thank you!

The best available coding class out there! :D"
127,"Simply the best. If you are a beginner/intermediate programmer and want to learn python or want to learn about writing games, this is the class to take. The instructors are absolutely fantastic. They were having fun as they were teaching and you will too."
128,"I have taken 5 coursera and udacity courses and this is the best class I have taken. When people talk about the high cost of education, this course and ones like it should be a model for revamping our educational approach. Excellent class"
129,"Hey guys

I learned a lot from this course.

To be honest, I thought I wasn't qualified to finish the project that were ask on this course, but thanks to extraordinary good professor, and a lot of patience, I finished it.

I had no background on programming, and they were able to teach me thing that were beyond my reach.

Theses persons are incredible, and extraordinary for the work they offer to the world.

Thank you guys for made this course available, I love you."
130,"This is the way of teaching in the future. I must say the teachers are fun, and can explain Python very well. In the end of the two courses you made 7 games, which is really cool and gets you excited to program more!"
131,"A truly fantastic class, the best that I have taken online so far. The creators deserve a tremendous amount of praise for their work in developing a format that works for anyone regardless of skill level and hardware. While suitable for beginners, the class is by no means totally simplistic and basic. If you are at all interested in programming in general or especially Python and game development in particular, you will certainly enjoy this class."
132,"This class was great, I highly recommend this class to not only people who are potentially looking for a job in this line of work but people who are looking for something fun to do or learn. this class is great and I thank all of the people who contributed to its creation, it has really helped me decide what I'm going to do for a job. I'm only 16 and I find this class very helpful, so you guys also influenced young minds to be future programerms."
133,"I really enjoyed this course, and it was made better by the professors who taught it. I went from a nobody who only really knew Minecraft commands to writing legitimately fun and playable games. The professors brought a great personality to the class, had friendly competitions but most importantly taught better than most of the educators I've had in the past. Overall I would really recommend the course to anyone who is even thinking about programming."
134,"Really great class! It's perfect for everybody, which let you enjoying programming and play with it. The design of the games are truly amazing and you can really learn a lot from it, not just Python."
135,"Top course. Instructors are great. Learnt a lot about GUI programming and OOP in general. Assignments are fun.

One of the greatest features is getting to see and mark other student's assignments. A lot of the time this will show you different ways of doing things that you hadn't considered before yourself. It's a great way to improve and expand your scope

Thanks Scott, Joe, John and everyone else. I'll be taking Principles of Computing next!"
136,"This was the first online course I'd ever taken. I believe that this course has spoiled my future experiences in the genre. It was so unbelievably fun to take. Joe, Scott, John and even Stephen kept a light-hearted approach in the weekly topic videos. They give you the tools to be just a little ""dangerous"" by the end.

I've dabbled in programming languages for the last 30 years, since I was a child in elementary school. This course was very easy to begin and very easy to progress. It's set up with a goal of writing a game (mini-project) every week and is geared toward those with no previous programming experience.

With 40,000+ students taking the course, peer assessment was definitely the way to go for the grading. The professors put together a grading rubric for every project that was comprehensive enough and worded just right. Each peer then graded, at a minimum, five other students' programs based upon the rubric's questions. Each of the mini-projects was a challenge, and it felt wonderful to hit that ""Submit"" button with a working version of every game throughout the course.

I sincerely hope to see more courses offered by this wonderful group of professors, as I've not had this much fun in a programming course, ever! Keep up the great work!"
137,"The pacing of this class was perfect for a beginning programmer. I started with only a little knowledge of programming, and by the end of the class, I was enthusiastically forcing all my friends to play my awesome game! I had to work hard to get my assignments in on time, but it didn't kill me, even though I was working a full time job while taking it. The professors are funny, and explain things really well while also keeping the class interesting. I'm suggesting this class to all my friends who have ever expressed an interest in exploring programming.

I also loved the way the class was structured. It was broken up into weeks, and each week was broken into two sections. Each section had a few lecture videos, and a quiz (which you could take multiple times, to make sure you really understand everything). Each week had a mini-project, where we made some little game to annoy our friends with. We peer-graded the projects, which turned out to be an awesome learning device, because we could try to find bugs in code that was similar-but-different from our own, and see how other students solved the same problems in slightly different ways. At the end of the course, I feel like I have a good set of stand-alone programs that I can brag about, and refer back to as I continue learning."
138,"I won't repeat everything that everyone else has already said about this excellent class... It is challenging if you are a complete beginner, but the discussion forum was a great help to me and I was able to finish my projects without any prior programming experience and had fun doing it. :-)

As for what people might expect of this class - if you are looking for an introduction into programming in general that basically gives you a feeling of ""I can do this!"" and accomplishment, this class is perfect.

If you are looking for a more general overview of what programming is all about and maybe less hands-on or project-specific teachings, I would suggest taking one of the ""Intro to CS"" classes out there - MIT has one that has been around for a while, and so does Harvard.

I took another class elsewhere along with this one, and had it not been for the Codeskulptor environment, and Professor Scott's and Joe's encouragement and great teaching methods with a sense of humor, and the very helpful fellow students and TAs on the discussion boards, I might have given up on the institution of programming altogether.

I highly recommend this class if you either are a beginner, or like games and would be interested in a Python-approach to building your own."
139,"This class was well-constructed and the projects and quizzes well-structured. As other reviewers noted, the professors teach while coding, which makes a huge difference, and the programming tips (ie places where one could get stuck) were fabulous.

The fact that you code in the Web browser makes the whole process less daunting and easy to show off to interested family members or friends once the assignment has been graded.

They deliver on their promise - except for the ""hello world (a shrubbery)"" project, you are in fact coding a game every week.

As a working person whose weekdays and nights were filled, I ended up doing most of the classwork every weekend, so I estimate about 15-16 hours a week on this class (less if you are fluent in other programming languages which I am not).

As a final note, it was easy to see the instructors and TAs cared whether you learned or not; they were in the forums constantly, and the code clinic responses were faster than they should be for a class of thousands. I like in-person, in-class learning and being able to study with other people, so a MOOC will always be second best method for me - but this class got as near to a real college course as I'm likely to find anywhere online. Great job!"
140,"This is a perfect introductory course to make you feel quite confident in Python. It has elements of fun brought by the lecturers in the videos. They try to give funny examples while explaining the concepts.

It also stimulates the brain and creates desirable difficulties needed to learn how to code. The mini projects might seem tough, especially when you're about to start. But the feeling of accomplishment upon their completion is wonderful. The projects are all about creating games which you can then make your friends and family play. It generally impresses all of them.

When you see the code after completing a mini-project, you will feel really proud at yourself. You will wonder how you managed to write so many lines of code all by yourself and will feel really smart. If you get stuck, you should go back and watch the lecture videos. You will find many hints there. The discussion forums are a great help too.

The quizzes are also very well made. Many of the questions cannot be answered without actually typing out some code in codeskulptor. So it gives you a lot of practice and makes you even more prepared for the mini-projects.

Overall, it was a great course and I definitely recommend it to all those who are reading this review."
141,"Fantastic class. Time consuming but the completion of the projects each week is very rewarding. The projects are challenging, yet they walk you though step-by-step, which keeps it from being overwhelming."
142,This class was fantastic. The professors did a really great job explaining the material very clearly and also provided a really fun and enjoyable learning environment. I recommend this class very highly.
143,"This was a fantastic introductory course. I've taken several MOOC's to try to learn Python in the past, and none has stuck until now. The projects are challenging but approachable; the videos are goofy and enjoyable, but also incredibly informative; and the projects that I built throughout the course are things that I feel really helped me progress in learning to program. I can't recommend this course, and Part 2, highly enough!"
144,"I've had awesome time studying this class. Before, I had had very small experience in Python programming, I had got information from different sources. It was too unorganized and I couldn't moving forward with that. Now, after this class I feel like I know all basic that I need to continue further my way in programming. Amazing teachers, who believe in each their student. They made this course fun and interesting. Thank you so much!"
145,"Do not hesitate! sign up! You'll learn Python in a stylish and funny way !!

And also you'll learn OOP as I never thought could be. Fantastic!

Thank you all of you

Toni"
146,"I had a lot of fun taking this class. It goes all the way from the basics to building a game in just a few weeks. The teachers are great.

I finally have a better understanding of object oriented programming.

I highly recommend it to everyone seriously looking into programming.

However it is more challenging than other courses I took. So really expect to put some work into it.

Thanks Joe, John, Scott and Stephen"
147,It's an excellent course for beginners like me! Mini projects help to apply the knowledge right away. The tips are really helpful.
148,"I am convinced that there is no better course than this one to study programming.

Even though I had some programming experience, it felt difficult every time I started an assignment. However, after long thoughts, I finally did the task, and I felt the appearance of growing as the 1st and 2nd weeks passed. It seems that the professors took a lot of care to submit the assignments.

Thanks to Scott and Joe."
149,"This class is absolutely wonderful. They use fun, interactive games to teach you Python. They introduce new material with every mini-project. At the end you feel as though you have accomplished so much. I especially loved the Professors. Their personalities were quite likeable and very funny at times. I wish every class had these guys teaching it as they were great at what they do."
150,This is an excellent course to learn Python and programming as a beginner. The weeks are progressive at the right rate. The projects allow students to practice what they've learned as well as learn to overcome bugs and think through problems. The quizzes are themselves good exercises to learn the material. The instructors teach well and bring a lot of fun and excitement to the course.
151,"Well structured.

The instructors are engaging and informative.

There are plenty of practice exercises and assignments that you'll have to work fairly hard to complete, and it may be a tad frustrating to get through the whole eight weeks, but it all pays off well in the end because you'll have a solid foundation of knowledge. Your skill definitely improves with the learning curve."
152,"Excellent. I think is a complete course about learning Python, is a good course that everyone could take it ( no matter if you speak a little english, the instructors speak as well as they can, so understandable). I think is the best course I have done till now. I can do a summary of 3 words to describe this course: Interesting, fun and useful! Really, Many thank you!!!!"
153,"I started this class with no experience programming. All the instructors taught in a way that by the time I was finished, coding felt natural, like something I was always meant to do. Every instructor brought something to the table to make that weeks material more comprehensive. CodeSkulptor is awesome and provides a great base to begin your journey to being a coder!"
154,"Excellent course. I really enjoyed it. Teachers are excellent, very clear and knowledgeable. The material is great and the projects are very interesting and motivating. It is very satisfying to complete the projects and watch them working and they open your mind to a thousand ideas - games AND other... I wish there were more courses like this, it is just so much fun!"
155,"I go with what everyone else said about this course but want to add a few cons:

From about week two or three it's starting to get less optimal for people who are completely new to programming. Things aren't being explained thoroughly that people who are new to programming won't understand (unless they research it or ask someone).

But I think it's only because it sometimes can be hard to see from a beginner's perspective if your brain is already hardwired to programming techniques for years. :)

So other than that the instructors sure try their best to get accross the concepts and are doing well!

Then there was another thing that was lacking.

A friend of mine once said ""You don't learn the programming language, you learn how to program."" (referring to my education back then)

That's exactly what I was missing in this course. You didn't learn how to program efficiently. You only learned the functions etc. and pretty much the basics. I would wish for at least some more tips for how to write code so it's efficient, in which situations you should pay attention to what coding style etc.

And I think that's pretty much it.

Other than that I really liked the geeky and kind characters of the professors :)"
156,"A most excellent course, and fun.

Having to mark & review your peer/classmates works is unusual, and choresome. But it keeps to costs down to .... zero, and sometimes this could spur you to improve your own program codes, and sometimes make you want to make suggestions to help others.

For me, this was an amazing 3-in-1 course .. (1) I get to learn a new language Python, (2) more practise in object-orientated programming in very most syntax-friendly language, and (3) be well guided to work out the steps to write some games that show up pretty nicely in a HTML5 webbrowser.

Thanks to Codeskulptor, a Python mini-development environment for teaching (which Professor Rixner built on top of a specialised JavaScript in-browser Python demonstrator created by some other open-source contributor), you are able to do real programming straight away via just the webbrowser alone (albeit it should be Chrome or Firefox, though the latter's HTML wont process some sound files). So you don't need the hassle of installing any software, plugins, or have administrator access on any PC you want to work from. Your codes are saved & easily accessible by anyone in the cloud (via some short auto-generated cryptic URLs)!"
157,"This was first on-line course I've actually finished. Even though I have found coursera.org about a year ago.

The reason that helped me to accomplish this course is its developers: Joe Warren, Scott Rixner and their colleagues.

When I attempted to learn some programming by youtube videos or something else, it always ended up in few days as i got bored pretty much within 15 minutes.

A small project every week - this is a brilliant idea! not just loads of theory with meaningless examples, but actually something that works! These guys are genius!

Course kept me interested in what's coming next throughout all 2 months.

The idea to create a game which you can actually play!

That what kept me going. Also guys help a lot by keeping videos funny and not so ""nuclear-programming"", but more of ""fun-time programming""

I have a background of few years of C programming while in a school 7 years ago, and general engineering profession.

Course was pretty easy for me.

What I suggest that might help and extend the students knowledge base - is to provide some links to another topic-related video tutorials online in the end of each lesson.

Thank you guys a lot!"
158,"This class was excellent. I am a research engineer at a large government institution. I haven't taken a programming course in almost 30 years (F77). I knew very little about interactive programming and object oriented theory. Having taken this course, I am now proficient enough to write professional level programs for real-world national security applications.

This course was taught to approximately 50,000 students, so the material had to be presented at a pace suitable to nearly everyone. That means it went a little slowly at times. I suggest keeping this course up with a self-study option, so a person could get through all the material in just a few weeks if they desired. Of course, peer reviewing of projects would be more difficult to provide (perhaps completely impractical).

If available, I will ask student interns to take the self-study course and move through it quickly. Working nearly full-time (8 hr+ per day on salary) a smart and dedicated undergrad could completely grok this course if a few weeks.

The instructors were knowledgeable, articulate, and entertaining (really). Thank you to all who made this difficult undertaking appear easy."
159,"Even though I'd graduated from college in computer programming, I remained fearful and disdainful of the field for a number of years. (Formal education has that effect on me.) Lately, I screwed up the courage to try my hand at it again--namely, game programming, the one thing I'd really wanted to do--and I wanted a course that wouldn't be overwhelming. After comparing all the Coursera offerings in this area of study, I chose this course, and now I'm quite glad I did.

The early projects were easy, but those in the latter half proved quite a challenge, even with my background. Thankfully, the lecture videos, the unit quizzes, the project templates, and the CodeSkulptor documentation were all brilliant, and helped ensure my success at every step. The competency, enthusiasm, and earnestness of the professors offering this free course are incredible, and really motivated me to continue even when I felt like giving up. The final project in particular, for which the professors went to especially great lengths in getting art and sound assets, was well worth the trip.

I would definitely take a follow-up course, which I'm hoping will be offered someday soon."
160,"TL:DR - Invaluable learning experience for a newbie to Python and OOP, professors of exceptional dedication and talent making the learning easy as can be, great course all-round. I recommend it ++++.

I knew close to nothing about programming when I started this class, and learned a whole lot about Object Oriented Programming and Python in just two months. The professors made it easy to progress, which is no small feat. Their apparent relaxation was only allowed by what I know must have been a great deal of work. The community forums that were vibrant with activity and provided answers each time I and countless others needed it.

In many ways, from the feeling of the lectures to the sheer efficiency of the teaching, this has felt more like a one on one class than a massive course with thousands learning, and I was blown away by the quality of it all. I hadn't felt such a pleasure of learning since I'd left university basically, and as a game designer, what I've learned here is invaluable. I would recommend this for anyone, especially real newbies like I am/was. If one of the professors happens to read this - thank you thank you thank you."
161,"Great course! Not my first course and, to be honest, not the best one, but it has solid 2nd place. Here I've understood OOP and classes finaly. At the end of the cource you will have enough knowledge to write such a game http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user47_Ayfs4gH0Dy_0.py (it's final project so don't look at the code if you'd like to avoid spoilers)."
162,"As someone who had never used Python and had only coded in C++, I found this course very helpful. Emailing the CodeClinic produced fast resolutions to any issues I encountered, and the quizzes in particular I found very helpful, they were that perfect level of making your brain work hard but also always able to pass once you reviewed the class material."
163,"best programming course i've ever taken, great instructors, great projects, and really informative. the emphasis on interactive programmes makes each week's project actually exciting, and extremely rewarding compared to other courses where the only thing you create are programmes that make long lists of numbers or phrases. highly recommend."
164,The way the course is constructed is extremely accessible. They have put a lot of effort into the lectures and the resources to help you along the way. The mini projects they chose were enjoyable to do and you actually felt proud for creating working games. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to start their programming journey.
165,Very good teachers .They explain everything nicely and projects are so much fun :)
166,"Though I am a total novice to Python programming, this course made the subject matter (relatively) easy and definitely fun. The instructors are informative and really seem to enjoy what they're doing. The CodeSkulptor interface provides the ability to work from any internet-enabled computer. Definitely recommend the course!"
167,"The course content is pretty good, the only con is that sometimes the practice exercises are a bit vague. The Instructors, make accidental mistakes and purposeful in the video, but in the end, they teach what not to do and what not.
Overall, the class was great as for me(an 8th grader), it inspired me program more with Python."
168,"This was an awesome class with a lot of fun learning python,"
169,Great course on introduction to programming. Great instructors and well organised content with moderately complex homeworks and quizzes. All content is consistently presented and leads you right to the homework. All mini projects and assignments complemented by well structured steps for successful execution.
170,Absolutely loved this course. The course is very well organised and i learnt a lot from this course. I would recommend everyone who are willing to learn python to take up this course. I want to thank my instructors. They were very encouraging and friendly through out the course. Thank You :)
171,"This is the place to go for the beginner or the person who took one or two not very good programming classes in college.

On the more difficult homeworks, Professor Joe Warren went out of his way to help me iron out a few bugs that enabled me to complete very satisfying games such as Blackjack and Asteroids.

I asked him to strongly consider offering follow-up MOOCs. and was encouraged to hear that Rice University probably will. If so, I hope - and believe - they will continue in the tradition of this marvelous class.

Professor Rixner put together Codeskulpor - a brillant online programming environment for beginning programmers to get around the technical headaches of many programming environments.

The assignments were ""Goldilocks like"" to borrow a term from a book I read called ""Drive"" by Daniel Pink. They weren't too easy, and not to difficult (especially with timely assists from the venerable Code Clinic). They were designed at a perfect level for learning and keeping motivated.

Thank you so much Rice University. I have tried a few other MOOCS. This is the best one I've taken to date.

Doug Hanway"
172,"This class was excellent. The organization of the class far surpasses previous classes I have taken both on-line and in person.

The care and engagement of the instructors clearly came through in the videos. The videos were well thought out. What made the class even more enjoyable was the quirky personality of instructors that was apparent in the lecture.

I have programmed previously and this class was able to bring back the joy of programming that I used to experience.

One criticism that I often read about these classes is the lack of personal interaction. This is simply not the case. There is far more interaction in the forums than anyone could hope for in an in-person class. The breadth of experience of those taking the class quickly leads to thoughtful answers in the forums.

The class itself does move quite quickly and may be a problem for those without previous programming experience. Even with that I would encourage people who have an interest to give it a try. Again, there is a lot of help in the forums and you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Kudos and thanks to Joe Warren and Scott Rixner for a great class!"
173,"Really good class. The Profs are great guys with a sense of humor, and teach the course really well. Above all, this is just a FUN way of learning. What other lectures involve you playing computer games?

Scott has built a version of Python (based on python 2.7.3 - that will mean something to you once you've finished this!) which is entirely browser-based. You don't need to install any complex software or even save files. All your work is stored in the cloud... it just works.

I'd done a (very) little programming before, so I found the first couple of weeks pretty straight forward. But when the object oriented class showed up and we had to build a game of Black Jack, that was really challenging. Don't go in to this class thinking it will be a walk in the park, because NOTHING WORTH DOING IS EASY. And as such, you need to put the hours in. I'm kind of glad the course is over now as I'll get my Saturdays back...

The only thing that would be a nice extra is to get some kind of certificate of achievement, perhaps with a grade. Not that it would hold any Rice currency, but just for bragging rights...

Phil"
174,"I have completed degrees in the past and am currently midway through a Computer Science degree but this course was by far and away the best course I have ever studied.

The professors made a huge effort in creating the class. They really put a lot of effort into making this class accessible, fun and engaging for new programmers. They broke each week's task down into easily accessible parts and created a nice learning environment (CodeSkulptor) in which we could try out our Python code.

I looked forward to the new projects each week and really enjoyed the video tutorials. There was a lot of good chemistry between professors Warren, Rixner, Greiner and Wong, which made the videos funny and interesting to watch.

I have not studied Python before (only Java) so I really learnt a lot from this course each week. Having completed this course, I feel confident that I could go on and do further programming in Python in the future.

I hope these Rice professors will think about doing an intermediate course as it would be great to learn more from them.

It's been a really positive learning experience for me!!"
175,"I really enjoyed this class. It was well organized and each week it took me through a different topic which was based on a building block from the previous week.

The lecture videos included material that was easy to follow and had great explanations from the instructors. All the instructors did a terrific job explaining the material and using examples to help the students understand the topics.

The mini projects were based on material covered in the lectures which helped to enforced learning of the topic.

The TAs did a great job too. Without their assistance and that of the instructors, I would not have been successful in completing most of the mini projects. I was really surprised when I submitted my code to the clinic and was assisted by Joe. Wow, I never expected that.

The forums were another helpful source of information. It was so refreshing to meet peers who were willing to assist others.

I can't think of anything I disliked about the course.

I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning to program and want to meet a group of excellent instructors and TAs."
176,"This course deserves its place at the top of the list of ""Best MOOC's."" I've taken more than a dozen courses (mostly technical) including paid Certificate programs. This one stands out as truly first rate.

This was my second Python class (I started with the Univ. Of Michigan Python Intro by Chuck Severance) and I'm glad I had some background before I took it. The pace felt rapid and without some prior prep you will spend more time than you planned to complete the assignments.

That said, let's focus on the positives. The first is Code Sculptor, the web-based programming environment in which you learn Python. For ease of use and quality of documentation it is unequalled. Next, there is always help available. I find programming can be frustrating at times and I never felt alone. The course forums were well used and well monitored. Somebody was always ready to lend a suggestion or point the way.

Although the course is taught through a series of ever-more-challenging video games for the student to script, you come away with a solid general knowledge of Python. Just be ready to put in some hours!"
177,"The best damn introductory programming course! period. Prof Scott Rixner and Joe Warren make it fun for all levels. I have over 30 years of programming behind me and had heard of Python and just happened by accident to see a news article on MOOC's and Coursera and that's how I discovered it. You don't need anything other than a strong desire to learn and have a good internet connection to watch the videos and do the mini projects and answer one or two quizes a week. I have a regular job 8/10 hours a day, exercise daily for an hour or more and still found time to do this class. Despite all my experience I had to work at the mini projects on the weekends and it was such a thrill to finally see the ""game"" finally work. Unlike a real classroom - you will have to learn to use the Discussion forums for answers to some questions you have. The class participants are ever willing to help and offer suggestions. IMHO I think Coursera has built a fantastic online platform but what distinguishes it from the rest is courses like this! I wish Joe and Scott many happy years making this class even better!"
178,"Before jumping into An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, offered by Rice University, I was attempting to learn Python on my own. I was not happy with how my progress was going, I couldn't see the big picture. That all changed with the way Joe Warren and Scott Rixner presented the pertinent information, while giving glimpses of it's larger context. While challenging, the class is easily manageable if you short on time and are determined to understand the material. The mode of learning how to program through creating games is a huge boon to most types of people. I feel this is because you can immediately present and show off what you've accomplished to give yourself a morale boost and continue on after a hard week of struggling through concepts that are presented. I would highly recommend this course for beginners, novices, and really all levels of programming understanding. There's so much to add to your programs, even after you've finished the assignments. Just remember to turn them in on time! I may have missed the deadline twice even though I finished days before it was due. oops!"

180,"I have completed part 2 as well and I feel so happy and proud to be part of such a wonderful course. I have never come across such wonderful instructors, exhaustive assignments and proper explanations all in one course before. The instructors are as excited as beginners and their enthusiasm is simply infectious. Codeskulptor is a wonderful place to start learning how to write your code and the viz mode is a powerful tool for efficient debugging. Using it simply cements the concepts covered in the class in your mind. The assignments are designed to make the learner write and debug code systematically while being somewhat challenging for beginners. Undoubtedly a lot of time and effort has been put into making this course and all its materials so that it can be as enjoyable and informative as it is. After completing the assignments, I feel that I need to develop more games. In fact I developed a simple version of tic tac toe game after completing the first part. This course has motivated me strongly to learn programming further and develop my own little games as practice work in my free time."
181,"A great course for beginners. The classes are well explained with an easy didactic that is complemented with exercises that at first seem difficult, but that with the guide, the templates and as tips for possible mistakes, it is very stimulating to continue and overcome the challenges and finish the course"
182,Great course. Learned GUI Python easy and efficiently.
183,This class is extremely well designed. It is very engaging.
184,"Fantastic, one of the best courses I have ever taken"
185,"It is really a very useful course made especially for beginners . The instructors, Scout and Joe are amazing. They construct a special python code editor to make it easy for beginners that is ""Codesculptor"" . The course contains everything a beginner needs to start coding in python."
186,"An amazing course. Loved the instructors, they had a sense of humor (but if it's ""good"" is left to you to decide :) ), the course was organized well, and the difficulty seemed to (for me at least) pace quite well from beginner material to more challenging in depth programming by the end!"
187,"Very good introduction to programming, very informative course, with valuable programming lessons, projects, exercises to practice with, lot's of people doing it so it's easy to get help on the forums when you're stuck in a problem, and the teachers are good at explaining the material"
188,"Solid teaching of the key concepts, and I really enjoyed the content and projects. My only complaint is about the platform. See:

https://coursera.community/ideas-suggestions-for-coursera-58/feature-request-validate-limit-peer-review-submissions-10968?postid=34892#post34892"
189,"This course helped me get into programming and has motivated me to keep learning more and more about its endless possibilities. The instructors are both great at teaching and charismatic, which make taking course all the more enjoyable. I definitely recommend this course."
190,"Thank you very much for this python programming class, it gave me a lot of confidence to learn and experience the fun of using python.
I really like the teaching method of this course. I will recommend it to anyone who wants to learn python if I have a chance."
191,"LEARN BY DOING. The course is quite challenging, even for those who have previous experience with programming languages. But never walking alone: explanations, tips, comments, guidance, common errors, examples, more explanations, more examples, and over all FUN."
192,I loved this course. The professors here are very much talented and know very deeply about the subject. I love the way they teach us and i thank them for making us also to work with Python. This is one of the best courses I have taken until now. Thank you
193,This course is Just wonderful. Iam really happy to say that this is the best course I have done till now.Thank you so much.And you taught this course differently.The unique and fun elements you people bought in between class was wonderful.Thanks again:)
194,It was a good course. i mean that i have tried python earlier from some courses from udemy and other platforms too but i got bored in some time i was not able to go half way in it but when i started this course i didint get bored it was really interesting .
195,I loved the classes a lot and the mini-projects were also interesting. It was a good start for me to work on python. On personal note my favorite teacher was Scott Rixner. I really enjoyed his jokes in between the classes. PS: The ties look good on you Scott.
196,"GOOD This is a great course. The teacher not only knows his material, but has a lot of experience working with first time programmers and so knows what errors they are likely to make and what questions they are likely to ask and addresses them all..."
197,"My background is experienced but not professional programmer (different language). My friend recommended this class to me at the last minute. Took it to learn more about python than anything else. To sum this course up in one phrase: Lighting in a bottle. Every single thing about this class was so well done and well thought out. It literally sucked me in even though I knew I was not getting any formal credit. The pace was fast but it almost didn't matter. It was fun. It was the right mix of dense material in bite-sized chunks (videos) with humor, fun and frequent quizzes, mini-projects that were sometimes trivial (first ones) but never boring. Really hard to describe it. Like I said, lighting in a bottle. After taking a few classes on Coursera including Andrew Ng's highly acclaimed ML class, I can say this one was the best in terms of overall experience. It's probably closest to what I have read Andrew to proclaim he wants to see for Coursera class formats (repetition brings mastery). I'm sure he is proud of the results for this class. Bravo for a job well done to the whole team."
198,"I followed this course during eight weeks during october - december in 2013 and I've really appreciated this course. I had previous experience from other programming languages but this was my first encounter with Object Oriented Programming. Consequently, I had a bit of 'a walk in the park' up 'til week 5 where I slammed the wall - literally. After a minor crisis I came through with that week's assignment alright and the following weeks tought me more than I've learned in programming over the previous years!

The course had a very well weighted mixture of leraning oportunities through video classes, practice excercises, quizzes and mini-projects, and on top of that discussion foras for assistment on specific problems. Also a portion of coding style was taught wich was a help in solving more complex programming tasks.

The course also benefits from the relaxed atmosphere spread by the teachers through the video classes. They made every challenge seem possible to undertake, yet did not trivialize challenges but rather pointed out the possible way of solution."
199,"At the start of the program the instructor showed a video of a game to be made in the final week and I thought, ""hmm! that is way beyond what I will probably reach"". In any case I decided to stick around.

The first week started with a ""Hello World"" level assignment and the weekly learning and projects increased in complexity but I could feel at home. Discussions in the forums showed that others were progressing along nicely.

About 6 weeks in, I recalled my thoughts in the first week about the complexity of the final project. ""hmm! I still don't think we have reached where we need to reach to be able to do that project."" But I was confident that the course will cover the needs and the project will be done. Sure enough it was done. I peer assessed 5+ random peers each week and I could see that all of them had done the respective project just as well or better.

Good introduction to OOB in Python. Feel very confident about my Python scripting ability now. Highly recommend this course.

The instructors were fun."
200,"This two-course program was my second Python MOOC. The first, also taken on the Coursera.org platform, was the five-course ""Python for Everybody"" specialization from the U. of Mich. Both of these were excellent. While they were both designed for beginners, they focused on very different things. The U. Mich. course focused on writing code to extract information from files, connecting with data sources on the internet, and organizing data in databases, all on an introductory level. The Rice U. course, on the other hand, focused on building simple games. Thus, the U. Mich. course taught us how to parse text strings and dictionaries, while the Rice U. course taught us how to create and use classes of objects. There was surprisingly little overlap between the two, and I feel very lucky that I found both courses and stuck with them to completion.

The teachers for both courses were excellent, albeit very different. There is no one best way to teach well, and they proved that. Hats off to all of the teachers of both schools."
201,"Excellent.. The way of teaching and showing the information is awesome!!
Today I finished the course number 1 of the seven available and tomorrow I will start the second course
Joe, Scott, John, Stephen
You are the best techers I have ever had!!!"
202,Great course! Love the way they teach. You will learn a lot of the fundamental stuff about interactive programming and object-oriented programming. And you complete the course with a few games that are built by yourself! What an awesome experience.
203,"This class is a really engaging way to learn Python. Even though my goal is not to continue with making games, it was a very good way to start with the language! I will continue my learning with the Fundamentals of Computing course also from Rice"
204,"This course is brilliant. It was a very interesting, useful journey.

Excellent teachers, great material. I've studied basic of Python, lots of new material and used it a few nice projects.

Thank you very much! I recommend this course!"
205,"it is interesting for beginners as it made in interactive programming way, which allows to make some beautiful game :)

I would like to see some more job-oriented course from these teachers for intermediate students who want to go further."
206,"Wonderful class and great teachers! I've never programmed before and Joe and Scott make the course really interesting and friendly :) If you want to start programming, you should take this course!
PS: pay attention to the ties ;)"
207,"It was an amazing experience.Honestly,the instructors were awesome throughout whole course.Joe and scott made the borings topics really enjoyable by their silly tie fight.I think it's one of the best course in python and best in GUI."
208,Great course. I have taken a couple of other introductory Python courses but this was the first to introduce event driven programming. The programming concepts really sink in by making fun games! Lecturers are engaging and entertaining.
209,"This course is so great! The course is very friendly to beginners. And there are numerous projects so that students have plenty of exercise experience to code. The project description is very detailed, which gave me a clear route to code."
210,Great and thorough introduction to programming in general and python specifically. The progression the instructors lead you through is well thought out and covers all the content you need to be successful with the projects they assign.
211,"Excellent in every way! Genuinely passionate instructors offering a gradual (yet adequately challenging), natural progression to learn Python. Easy to understand materials, good community support, fantastic exercises, and fun projects!"
212,Awesome. I learnt in few weeks basic concepts of Python and now i am going to specialize my Python knoledge practicing it with more and more excercises. Great teachers and great CodeSkulptor ! Professors let's continue on this way!
213,"An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python is an amazing class to make your first steps in programming. Instructors put a tremendous amount of work into the class and made the course interactive, fun and challenging."
214,"Very fun but elegant introduction to coding and programming that goes from the very basics to the principles of object oriented programming. Very intuitive, you're gonna learn the fundamentals of coding developing fun videogames."
215,"All the teaching material is well organized. Many of the projects may seem intimidating, but the professors have very much experience, and they provide you with tips that make you overcome the difficulties you may face."
216,"My experience in this class was amazing; they have excellent teachers that give out lectures, simple and clear examples about the subject they're lecturing on, and best of all is that they try their best in making the course fun by just being themselves.

- They lectures they give out are about 10 - 15 mins., but some of them are less then 10 mins. with integrated quizzes( Not all videos have them)

- They have homework and practice questions if you need more practice and their forums are always open with people ready to help you if you need any.

- Their mini-projects are extremely fun (Don't worry! You don't have to program the whole thing, they provide a code template for you, and you just have follow the instructions and do the rest.)

All in all, I recommend this course for anyone who is interested in maybe learning a new skill, reviewing/renewing your current skills, or a just for fun ""I want to see what this course is about"" - you won't regret it! Enjoy it and hope you have as much fun as I did!"
217,"The best thing about this course is that it teaches the concepts of Python in a fun and engaging way. Coming in, people would attempt to learn the course either out of sheer desire for learning or as a requirement. This course presents the concepts in a way that you learn them as you are doing something fun.

The instructors also do a good job of keeping the course material engaging and memorable as they can. They give enough programming tips to get you through the mini-projects (maybe giving a little too much at times) but you should be able to use the concepts to get you through each step.

Only concern perhaps is the transmissibility of the knowledge. Most of the concepts especially leading to the 2nd half of the course deal heavily with simplegui which, while engaging and robust enough for the course material and creating 2D Games, leaves little transmissibility in terms of how Python is used in real-world applications.

If you're in it for learning Python in a fun and engaging manner, this is the course to take."
218,"If you have some programming experience but are totally new to Python, this is the perfect class for you. If you've never written a program or script before, then you should find an introduction to programming class and take that first. On the flipside, you don't need to know anything at all about Python to take this class and you'll be writing interactive games almost right away.

The layout of this class is great. Teaching in a virtual environment (recorded lectures) seems challenging, but the teaching staff that created and delivered this class did a great job making this class enjoyable. They provide you with all the tools you need to succeed with each week's assignment. If you watch the lectures and do the projects, you will be proficient at Python by the end of the course.

Expect to spend about 10 hours per week on the course between lectures, quizzes, a mini-project, and grading other students' projects (you have to grade 5 students' projects each week and the criteria is spelled out very clearly)."
219,"This is a well-conceived, designed, and implemented course. I am aware of what it takes to put together good training material and Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong do an excellent job of executing this class. I admire the fact that they continue to evolve the course, given the feedback they receive. They have done a great job of balancing instructional material, technical data, documentation, and humor to keep the class flowing at an appropriate pace. I started the class with no formal programming experience though I have been involved in software development by producing 2D and 3D graphics for quite some time. My career experience gave me a strong conceptual understanding of the software development issues but this course gave me the fundamental understanding that I had desired. This was my 3rd MOOC that I have taken and this has by far been the best. It did take a significant commitment of time to complete the course and I feel that my time was well spent being involved in this course!"
220,"I have been programming for a long time but have spent most of my time on scientific simulations with very little GUI experience. This class was great, even for an old dog. The video lectures were short and meaningful, and I even enjoyed the corny humor and picturesque T-shirts of Professor Warren. The quizzes were helpful in making sure you understood the material, and you could take them up to 5 times, if you did not score well on your initial test. The projects were interesting and just challenging enough. Whether you're a newbie programmer or someone with lots of programming miles, I think you'll learn a lot from this class and enjoy the challenge of making interesting games. The final project, a version of Asteroids called RiceRocks, was full featured and very playable. Try out the course! You'll like it. P.S. The CodeSkulpter environment and the simplegui module, built by Professor Rixner, were instrumental to the success of the class because everything could be done through a web browser."
221,"Overall a very good, understandable and thorough introduction to Python programming. The progression is good, the video lectures, practice exercises and quizzes are quite challenging, but at the same time within reach."
222,"Absolutely the best beginner friendly Python course you can find online. I've been attending so many courses but none of them is comparable to ""An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"" by Rice University."
223,"I highly passionately recommend this class especially to those with no experience! This is just what a beginner needs. Besides, you will never see instructors who will teach with such excitement and fun!

Thank you!"
224,"Great course. One of those that you can clearly see that the people behind it have put a lot of effort into it. Lots of useful lectures and lots of practice, the two ingredients that will actually teach you to code."
225,"A very good course - taught me a lot about Python. Very well designed. A journey of video lectures, exercises, tests and projects - each building on the last and helping me develop ideas. Highly recommended."
226,"Its a very good experience, I have learned a lot. The teaching style is very students friendly.

The instructors are very passionate about these class and teach in the way that anybody can easily understand."
227,I have learned a lot even though I did not have past experience with python. The teachers were fantastic with very good teaching experience. Projects helped a lot to get into deep knowledge about python.
228,The class is a fantastic and interesting introduction to python programming. My only downside is using codeskulptor instead of a local ide leaves a gap when trying to apply what you learned on your own.
229,"Brilliant course! I've taken online courses in Python before, but this is the first one where I've felt like I've gained knowledge and skills that I can build on and apply in other contexts."
230,"Very badVery badVery badVery badVery badVery badVery badVery badVery badVery badVery bad
Not at all for free
Asks money.
Says will give you only a one week free.
Not worth
Should not purchase.
Liars"
231,Fantastic course for beginners! The classes are interesting and organized! The tool fo programming is easy to get started! The assignments are not difficult but do require you spend some time.
232,"Overall the course was wonderful! I learned a lot as a beginner, from printing in the console, to building games. The professors were really great! All the instructions were clear and understandable."
233,"Good enough to understand the Python.
It was good learning by this program to apply the Python to analyze the big data.

It was good information to be an expert for data scientist."
234,"Great class, amazing teachers.

First of all the class is really well designed: video are not too long like in many other classes, the pace of the course is quite fast but in a good way (in MOOC we can watch videos several times so there is no need to repeat always the same things), mini-projects are challenging but thanks to the template, the guideline and forums it’s possible to finish all of them and CodeSkulptor is really a great idea and a great development. So I was able to learn a lot of things (and much more than in other online classes on introduction to programming).

Second of all, professors are amazing: concepts are well explained in videos, they make many efforts to entertain ourselves and make the class more enjoyable and they spend a lot of time in forums. I’ve always thought that learning is fun but I have to admit that is more fun with Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner and Stephen Wong. Thanks to them this class was really my best learning experience online and offline."
235,"This is one of the best computer science courses I have taken. The instructors are excellent, clear, and engaging. I learned a lot about coding in Python. The mini-projects are challenging, and extremely rewarding. My favorite aspect of this course was the peer assessment, where you review other students' code for the same projects. I learned other ways to code the projects, and it was simply fun to do! The rubrics for this are extremely clear and easy to test. Another excellent aspect of this class is that you do not have to download a python server; all you have to do is google codeskulptor.org, and you have a great way to code python in your browser! Whenever I take a computer science class, I always dread having to download the server. However, using and downloading (you don't have to) codeskulptor is easy! Finally, the forums are also helpful, since one can receive fast answers about coding problems from the instructors themselves, who have developed codeskulptor. I highly recommend this course."
236,"I wasn't sure how much to expect from an introductory course in Python from a not very well known university (compared to the many courses from Stanford, MIT etc) and so was very pleasantly surprised at just how great it turned out to be.

The first thing that struck me when I started was the sheer enthusiasm and effort of the professors - when someone is prepared to put in the time to write custom tools for the class alone you know they're not just doing it 'because it's a fad and everyone else does'.

A bit easy at times, with the templates already containing half the code you need for an assignment, but then again this is a beginner's course for people who may never have programmed before.

Hands down the most enjoyable MOOC I took part in and is guaranteed to teach the basics of Python while keeping it fun and engaging. Would recommend for anyone willing to learn about Python or programming in general - I hope we'll get a course on Java or Android from the Rice professors too, one day."
237,"This class was amazing! The teachers were amazing, and I learned quite much from it. Before, I only knew the syntax of python from Codecademy, and I didn't know how to actually apply it to anything, but from here, I learned many valuable tools from which I can now expend on to actually make some programs I wish to make. This course was truly a gateway to real programming from what I only knew as syntax.

The instructors were kind and I really enjoyed how they tried to engage their students with some humor in their video (of course, humors are not the focus of their video) and they really do know how to teach! I loved the lesson pace, and I really encourage any programming beginner to take this class because the lessons were well organized and compare to other course I took (as little as they are) this class's materials were concise and to the point, enabling their student to make really fun program and make them feel proud of themselves for their new accomplishment in rather short time."
238,"This is a really great course and a perfect way to start learning how to write programs on Python. Instructors are great, they don't try to be very serious and have fun creating this course. I, in turn, had so much fun building actual games each week! I could never think that I can create a game, but here I am.
This course really helped me with my university discipline, where I started learning Python a month ago, in September. I decided to enroll the course in summer to be prepared to my autumn course (because I wasn't sure I'll be good enough), and though my discipline in university is designed for further using Python as a data science tool, not for interactive programming, this course helped me very much. Thanks to Coursera, Scott, Joe, John, Stephen, stuff and my peers who evaluated my projects and helped me to become a better programmer.
P.S. Miss this course already and definitely going to start another course by these instructors in January,
P.P.S. Sorry for any mistakes."
239,"Great experience - a good journey, with some tough challenges, and lots of support and help.

This is billed as an Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python.

So it starts off as an Introduction, both to Python and to Programming.

If you have programmed before, it's going to feel easy to begin with and probably be manageable to the end - though it does take quite a bit of time and effort.

If you are new to programming, this course may seem hard, especially later on - e.g. when OO concepts are introduced. Perhaps some other resources would be useful for these people, maybe even taking a beginners programming course first.

Finally, this course is about Interactive programs, so it doesn't dwell too much on some of the intricacies of programming in general, or the specifics of Python, but concentrates on the necessary parts to be able to produce interactive programs.

It does this very well, and the teaching team make it fun and entertaining, as well as rewarding."
240,"I knew a thing or two about programming in Python before this class so I can say that the instructors did a good job in delivering knowledge I already had, as well as concepts that were new to me. Video-lectures were fun and well structured, quizzes did an excellent job at testing the our knowledge, and the Mini-projects are a terrific way to test our new skills. The Forum and he Code Clinic are great places if you're stuck and need help. Scott Rixner and Joe Warren are great teachers, and CodeSculptor is a great tool for people who are new to programming. VizMode is a great debugging tool, and although I didn't use it often, I think it's great for new programmes. John Greiner's ""Programming tips"" videos were very helpful, as were his instruction on how to use VizMode. Coursera, as a provider, was stable and easy to use. I had a great time taking this course and it motivated me not only to continue learning new programming techniques, but to take other courses as well."
241,Inclusion of platform like Codeskulptor makes this class unique. The instructors are thorough and the assignments are designed well irrespective of the the python skill of the learner.
242,"It teaches basic Python using games.

Codeskulptor is awesome as you dont need to download and install python, but use a web browser instead.

Organization of the instructors were great."
243,One of the greatest classes on python. It's really enjoyable. The teachers are really fun. They teach you python by playing. I really advice any new comer to the field to start wiith these.
244,Excellent course either for beginners or for people having previous experiences in other languages. If Object Oriented Programming and Python are unknown to you this course is the good one.
245,This course rocks! I didn't completely finish it (back to plumbing I guess) but I made a song about how cool it was doing Typhon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZt8K9h-2zo
246,"this course passed 7 years ago was a very start for me as a programmer, and now ima team lead python developer, so many thanks to these wonderful teachers!"
247,All the teachers are really great. Mini project format was engaging and kept the course really interesting while learning basics in Python.
248,"A great course for beginners. If anybody wants to learn Python from scratch, this course is for him. The instructor has taught quite patiently."
249,Great course to get started with programming for games. The course is well structured and helps solidify foundations for object oriented programming.
250,Great course for learning basic Python programming. The interface that was developed made it easy to start and the professors were great.
251,"Really good introduction class, teaching basic and complex things. They teach well and they are funny, making me wanting to learn more"
252,"An excellent course, very good teachers and staff, and fun, (sometimes very) challenging tasks, and very importantly - good support!"
253,"Excellent starting point into Python programming. Dr.Chuck has in my opinion, a excellent way of presenting and explaining."
254,Incredible course! Really puts all the elements that you will learn into mini-projects that really help you grasp the material!
255,The course was just wonderful. The instructors were funny and made the class very engaging. I would definitely recommend it.
256,"I really recommendable course to the people to want to learn how to programme. If doesn't matter if you haven't programme before, the course starts with the basics concepts and in a very well structure evolution it introduce you in the Orientated Object Programming (OOP) If you are an senior programmer it is a good course to know about the OOP and how to manage properly your programs

The length of the lessons is perfect (maximum 15 minutes, but usually around 10) and the use really nice examples to explain everything. The evaluation is very nice, the idea to do games for the exercises makes the homework much funnier and moreover, you always want to improve more and more your games, making you learn more and more.

The forum is also quite useful, it is pretty well structured and you can discus your doubts with your companions obtaining fast and accurate answers

In brief, a very recommendable course. You will enjoy and learn at the same time"
257,"I believe it is in my nature to be a little bit ""difficult"" about giving five stars, or ""excellent"" as a rate. This time before clicking on stars besides, I started to think about my expectations and what this course, material, instructors or environment could give me more. I soon realized that ""none"" was the true answer to my question. I give 5 stars to the content because I started from zero and now I am thinking about my next programming project. I give five stars to the instructors because they did a great job teaching and helping me get the best out the course and a plus for their humorous attitude. I believe they have spent lots of hours building it, and it shows. Great job guys. Finally, I give five stars to the provider (coursera) because of the easiness and usability of their environment. Great job there too guys. This was my first course at coursera, but I am sure many of them will follow. I fully recommended it. Thank you all!"
258,"This class was absolutely awesome. I took the class primarily because I was interested in learning some python and also I've never done any game development. I not only learned enough python to be able to branch out, I feel like I have a good solid base for making some fairly fun games. My son saw me make the Pong game, and he came up with an idea for a game that I then was able to make! (I'm even currently translating it into Pygame). I work in data analysis, and have found that there are plenty of modules out there to extend python for using in data analysis, but also being able to program games has become a worthwhile hobby that helps relax me and take me mind off of whatever data analysis problem I am trying to work out. This class helped me get there! It was a lot of fun, Joe, Scott, John and Stephen are great instructors and really make the material fun. I wholeheartedly recommend this class (besides, the price is right - FREE.)."
259,"I am a 53 year-old physician with no previous programming experience who took this course purely to fulfill an intellectual curiosity. I was rewarded beyond my expectations. I have been through many educational experiences in my life, both as a student and as a teacher. I recognize good teaching when I see it. These Rice professors are the cream of the crop. They are brilliant, articulate, and amicable. Also, they have created a web-based Python coding environment called CodeSkulptor (complete with its own graphical user interface and detailed documentation) that makes it a snap to get it started with Python. You can keep using CodeSkulptor forever after you have finished this class. I finished parts 1 and 2 of this course in a few short weeks and got hooked on the experience. I plan to keep taking additional courses by these professors in this specialization on Coursera. I give this course my highest recommendation."
260,"The class was everything that was advertized. By the second week of class you have been given enough tools to create useful programs and it's fun because they are games. I had no programming experience and worked full-time while taking the course. The course takes more time than advertised if you don't already know how to program so be warned. I highly recommend doing the practice exercises but I made it through without them because I didn't have enough time. Everything is structured, deadlines are well-known and posted, the pace is demanding, but the progress is amazing! I highly recommend the class for individuals with the motivation to stay on track. If you get behind it will be hard to make up the time but the beauty of a MOOC is that you can stay in the class and take it again. The instructors make it fun, the forums are a great help and if you want to learn to program then this class is the right choice."
261,Best course on python for someone who is absolutely new in programming. Professors Joe Warren and Scott Rixner are the best.
262,Excellent course. Extensive. Detailed. Challenging. The projects are step by step and take it one at a time.
263,"Pros: This is the first Coursera course I've taken and I've thoroughly enjoyed it. Very well structured class and Joe and Scott have a great style of teaching. They make the course fun and progressively more challenging. I've stayed up many nights towards the end of the course trying to get my mini projects to work. As the course progresses you realize that you get more and more comfortable with Python programming. If you want to get started with Python programming, I can't imagine a better way to do so. I would have gladly paid to take a course like this.

Cons: I wish that the last mini project time was 2 weeks instead of 1 week.

For folks like me who are working and have work deadlines and have to travel at times, it gets very difficult when you have to work through nights to meet mini project deadlines. However at the end, it was every bit worth going through it.

Thank You Joe and Scott."
264,"I first coded 30 years ago. Z80 machine code and Spectrum basic. Then I went on to do music as a profession and now having found time wanted to get back to my true love.. coding! I followed many courses but I must state that the Course offered by Rice University is by far the best one I have come across over the web. I'm still searching for a better one. The professors running the course are brilliant and I like their sense of humour and their simple unassuming ways. Kudos to you Rice Uni and Kudos to you great lecturers Joe Warren, Professor, Department of Computer Science, Scott Rixner, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, Stephen Wong, Lecturer, Department of Computer Science and John Greiner, Lecturer, Department of Computer Science. I am now half way thru and am a much better coder and writing my own code. My goal is to write some simple music software and games and distribute free."
265,"Very good course for anyone looking for a taste of what programming is about. The content has been carefully created to give a thorough introduction of python, and in no time, they get you going doing some very interesting projects. The feeling of succeeding at a mini-project and showing it to your friends afterwards is highly rewarding.
For the instructors I have nothing but praise. Both prof. Scott Rixner and prof. Joe Warren excel at making the whole process both useful as a learning exercise and engaging. They skilfully delve into the more difficult concepts and to soon after, jump-start the student with a fun exercise to put those concepts into use.
Regarding coursera, while flawless in computers, it is a pain to use in Android or iOS in the iPad. Whole sections will not load (such as the mini project pages), a change in the screen orientation (in Android) will refresh the app to the landing page."
266,"This class is extremely well structured. In fact, it may be the best structured class I have ever taken in or out of university. There is a very tight correspondence between lecture and exercise. And at least I did not run into the typical situation where I am working on problems and issues that were never really addressed at all by the class itself yet nonetheless have to figure out. (That is fine & enriching but if it happens often frustrating esp. when trying to just learn something new) I have a mathematical background, so the programming came fairly easy, but getting and familiarizing with the idiosyncrasies of some programming environment or library is often a labor intensive pain. That is why the use of code skulptor is great, in my humble opinion. It makes the doing much smoother and shifts the focus to programming concepts without getting bogged down in esoteric details."
267,"I scored 89%... should have done better but misunderstood one deadline and didn't get the project in that week. I am a 57-year-old ME who hadn't programmed much the last 20 years.

This really a tremendous way to teach, progressively adding another level to game building each week, reaching a climax the final week with a fairly involved Asteroids game. This type of teaching really works for me.

Basically, each week they have a video teaching Python language concepts. Then a video showing some more advanced programming concepts (often they aren't even used until the next week.) Then some ideas for what is needed to complete the project and how to get started. And finally some tips on what people commonly misunderstand.

Anyway, Joe, Scott and John made an excellent instructing team. Completing this course was well worth the time spent. I would take one of their courses again."
268,"I give this course the highest possible rating! I loved it and would like thank Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen. Thank you so much - you did a spectacular job.

The class did a really god job of introducing general python language constructs - lists, sets, classes... and the CodeSkulptor environment was a pleasure to work with.

But the best takeaway from the course was actually learning some of the fundamentals of building games. How to create motion, animations, collections of objects on the screen, the physics and geometry for simple motion and collisions - all of that was incredibly useful to learn.

The course was hard but rewarding - each week we built a different game. They ended up being fairly simple - yet reasonably fun to play. Any one of them would have been fun to work on longer to make it more polished.

Thanks again to the profs - I'm so happy I took this course."
269,"This is THE BEST course anyone can take for Python. The course is highly interactive. For the first time while taking an online course, I feel that I am actually taking a university-level class and interacting with other students and faculty. The professors and the entire staff are always available to help. I cannot praise this course enough.

I am in week 3 now and I love it so much that I searched for a place where I could write a review for this course and found this site.

THANK YOU, Mr. Warren, Mr. Rixner, Mr. Greiner and Mr. Wong!! Thank you Mr. Rixner for writing CodeSkulptor that makes learning Python a breeze and I can use any computer (even my tablet) without having to install Python interpreter. Thank you Mr. Warren making me laugh while a few times when I was watching the videos! Thanks to all of the TAs, especially Moria Merriweather who was always there to help."
270,"This class starts with a text-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game, but by the end, you'll be writing code for a spaceship that flies around shooting space rocks...IN SPACE.

It's a fantastic intro for beginning programmers, even people who've never written a single line of code! It's extremely accessible and presents small chunks of material that quizzes build on and projects force mastery of.

I'm not a beginner; I have a degree in Computer Science, actually. But I haven't used it to code anything for a long while and couldn't get up the motivation to get back into it. This course helped me rediscover my love of coding and creating, and I'll definitely be going on to create some original games of my own.

I fully believe that ***ABSOLUTELY ANYONE*** can take this course and become a game programmer. If you're considering it, stop considering and sign up *right now.*"
271,"One of the best classes I've ever taken. Without a doubt the best online class I've ever taken. The instructors are very enthusiastic and put a lot of work into making this class good. They do a great job teaching the concepts of interactive/event driven programming. There is one project to do a week, and they are all building games. By week two you are already moving into building interesting interactive programs, and you very quickly start learning how to add graphical elements to your games.

If you have absolutely no programming experience at all, I would recommend taking an intro to programming class before this one. It's not required, but it will be a lot more work if you don't. If you have some programming experience but are unfamiliar with python, the instructors do a good job of introducing python so don't let that deter you from taking the class."
272,"Great course for people who wants to learn programming and/or wants to learn Python. The lecturers were both great and enthusiastic. They teaches really well throughout the course that I can't say anything bad about them.

The videos and sounds are clear so you don't have to worry about the quality. Presentation and explanation are clear and concise which makes it easy to understand. You don't have to worry about installing Python for homework because the class uses Codeskulptor, designed by Scott, which is a web-based Python programming interface. All work is done there so you don't have to worry about anything.

Finally and once again, I encourage you to give this course a try. Python is a fairly easy scripting language which anyone (or everyone) can learn and pick up easily. After 9 weeks through this course, I am sure you will grasp Python language easily. :)"
273,"The class was great. Apart from the content and the organization, I would like to share my personal feelings so that you could see how amazing it is. There are Part 1 and Part 2 of this course, and I started taking Part2 in the middle of Part 1( personal reasons). I had other things to do as well, so the lectures and assignments were quite pushing me. However, I often completed one week's content and assignment in 1 day, sometimes 2. Why? I got the motivation to learn and to complete each task. I love the way I was gradually improving myself from a green hand to someone who got the courage to move on learning more about Python. Kind of a good start for my transition for non-CS major to data science. And I guess that is why so many people on forums such as Quora had recommended course for beginners. You won't feel so frustrated, and you exploited your potential."
274,"I had no idea about how to program before starting this course. On completion I am able to proudly show off the small games that I have created thanks to this excellent class. I had a lot of fun and gained immense satisfaction whenever I was able to get something working.

Although it says on the page that it takes 7-9 hours a week I found myself spending consederably more than that most weeks as the difficulty level increases quickly as it progresses.

You don't really need any prior knowledge for this course besides a decent command of English and the ability to think in an ordered and logical fashion. A good understanding of maths is helpful but they do explain any such concepts adequately. Above all, the enviroment in this course great with people always willing to help on the forums and the professors always offering help if you email them."
275,"This is the best course I have ever taken and probably would ever have chance to take. I simply loved all the mini-projects, the course content, the way the material is organized and more. In addition to the content of this course, I also loved every other aspect of it, including the jokes of Joe and ties of Scott. All of these make the course not only informative, but also fun to learn.
I sincerely want to thank all instructors for their efforts and want to say that the end result is fantastic: An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python fully does what it is supposed to do. Now that I have finished the two parts of this course, I am planning to take other courses by Rice University, such as Principles of Computing and Algorithmic Thinking. I hope those courses will be as interesting and rich in content as the current two-part course is."
276,"Amazing class. Amazing teachers. Even though I have some previous programming experience, I've never used python before. I have to say that this course made me love python. From the beginning they teach you just enough of Python so that you can do your assignment.

Assignments are very interesting, and they keep you wanting to learn more. So each week you progress, from a simple text based game, to an awesome looking asteroids clone with graphics, simple physics and sound.

You learn by doing, and if you get stuck, you can get help in the forums. This course has an amazing community, where you can get an answer in minutes.

I can't recommend this course highly enough. Even if you're not interested in game programming, in this course you will learn a lot, while have loads of fun making games. If the professors are reading this: THANK YOU!"
277,"The class is good, but I was frustrated that it depended on math concepts at times. This was not fair, or necessary. I took an intro programming class at Carnegie Mellon years ago that was challenging in PROGRAMMING concepts and that I ace'd but it did not require understanding math concepts. There was no need for that and it took away from the concept of learning HOW TO PROGRAM by making quiz performance dependent on recognizing the pattern of a logarithm for example. Since I had no clue what that was, I had to drop taking it for a grade. Say WHAT? THis was unnecessary and a barrier, and I think a way to limit who can learn to program, either deliberately or by this assumption that programming is all about formal math training or solving math problems. HOWEVER, the tools provided were excellent especially pyStep and the codeSkulptor."
278,"I have no words to describe that fantastic experience that I had in these 2 month. Its the best course ever. I really liked the way it was planned, the short lectures, the humor and atmosphere, and of course it content. I love playing computer games (and playing childhood games like pong and asteroids - own made was even extra fun) and had to learn python for my work, so I got 2 birds in one shot.

You guys made these videos, in a way, that I really felt like i'm actually sitting in your class (and even a small one), so even it was hard for me to spend the required time, listening, answering the quizzes and coding the mini-projects, and I'm happy to be able to ""return to my wife and kids"", I'm going to miss watching your videos. btw, some WERE crazy.

Thanks again, for preparing such a well design and warm course."
279,"I learned a lot from this course, also have a lot of fun, Classes are very well prepared, teachers really enjoy this course and make it amusing.

Classes start from the very basic to give us tools and knowledge to program a basic game.

Prior this course I did not had any formal programing background and difficulty/progression was adequate for me (I had some previous self learned knowledge as i use visual basic for Excel)

If you are interested in starting/knowing how to program this is a very good start.

I your starting point is zero use the extra material it is useful and needed as the course advances fast.

Finally as you rate your peers use that instance to learn / follow best practices.

I really recommend it, for people interested in learning to program. the course will demand time depending on your starting point."
280,"I have now taken four free online programming classes for beginners, and this was hands down the best. The other classes seemed to either be too technical and boring or the teachers tried to entertain you the whole time that you never really were taught anything about programming. With this class, it was put together great with a perfect mixture of technical, witty, and fun lessons. It was the perfect balance for beginners.

I felt I learned more with this class and have applied to my job already.

Lets not forget about Code Skulptor. It is such a great tool for beginners to learn on, and those with more experience to expand their knowledge easily. I enjoyed using it very much and continue to use it.

Thanks to the professors from Rice for doing this, I hope to see other classes taught by Rice professors in the near future."
281,"Exceptionally high quality: Video lectures. Even though a video lecture may only be 15 minutes, after four hours you might reach the end, especially with regard to the mini-projects which are expertly designed to move you forward into programming. Peer evaluation - absolutely excellent idea-see implentations of your mini-project by your peers, some much much better than yours, some not as good and LEARN. I will admit that two or three times I felt as though I would drop out the tasks seemed so daunting, but with perseverance and the support of the forums, Joe, Scott, John and Stephen, I nailed every mini-project, which is a true sense of achievement. So be prepared to dream in code for a few weeks, but you will be smiling when your friends, family and colleagues are playing games which YOU implemented. Sign up - do it now!"
282,"This was the first programming class that I have taken. Apart from typing in programs from computer magazines in the 80s, I've not programmed before. Right from the very beginning the lectures were well set out and progressed logically and the regular quizzes really helped to understand what was being taught. I really can't recommend this course enough for learning how to program. Making each program you write a game makes it fun to share with your family as to what you are doing, and has made me re-examine the code I've written to improve it with the ideas they have given me. The buzz you feel on not only successfully completing a project but also on getting the grades back was a real high. I'm going to miss not having new lectures each Saturday night to go over, and a new project to puzzle over each week. Take this course!"
283,"I had almost none experience in programming unlike I was having programming classes at my university. I thought I'm useless for this. BUT these guys really helped me to overcome all the difficulties in understanding what is programming, what is it for and how to use it. Before this class object oriented programming was a mystery for me and the only thing I was able to say about that was ""it has encapsulation and polymorphism"". That what I was learned before and I think only God knows what did people mean when they say that way. BUT the class did the job and now I know how to create classes, how to use them and I think I understand them. I spent something around 10 hours per week for this class in listening lectures, answering quizzes and writing games. BUT it was a REAL FUN to do that. Thank you, guys, for this."
284,"I love this class!!! One of the most amazing things in this class is that you see the instructors in the videos typing code as they go along, and making the same programming errors from time to time just like you do when writing code. Seeing this and hearing for example Joe Warren says that he has 40 years of programming experience, yet he still does mistakes makes you understand that errors are part of the process, and that it is OK to do mistakes. The second thing I most love about this class is that they teach how to build your code in an efficient way. Namely, they don't teach you just to write the code, but you learn how to logically think and plan your code! I'm most sure that this class will have a great impact on my programming and logical thinking skills in the near and far future. Thank you for a wonderful class!!!"
285,"It was wonderful course. I have been learning python on my own since almost 4 months, but could not implement things together to make a fruitful program. when I got introduced to this programme, the best thing was that within one week, I made a game, it was very exciting. I was actually seeing tangible things happening on the basis of my code. The professors are engaging, the content is good, and you are provided with docs too for reference. I am a full time student for this course, from pharma background, had no experience of programming (except the fact that I was teaching myself Python with my husbands help), and within one month I end up making asteroid game. So thats too much excitement and encouragement for me :). You have to check others code, which further enhances your skills for coding, so that's a good side too."
286,"One of the best programming classes i've taken so far, and i've been taking quite a few from coursera, edx, and udacity. The instructors were fun and very good and teaching the lecture topics. Videos were very well done, not too long, not too short.

My favorite 2 parts about the class were the instructors (very fun group of guys who were great teachers) and the codeskulptor app that you write your programs in. It was really fun to be able to have something you could show people what you were learning/working on from class. Especially the final project (asteroids clone), people couldn't believe i made a game like that, and looking back, i couldn't either!

Would highly recommend this class to anyone wanting a better grasp on interactive programming and to get your feet wet with making applications with GUI's."
287,"I came into this a knowledgeable beginner, but having written very little code. The profs were very active in the forums and responded to a purpose-made email address for homework help promptly. There was a massive effort to make the class fun, and it showed. There was one project that was particularly challenging (the blackjack project that was our first object-oriented program), and even the concluding lecture of the course acknowledged that there would be changes to that project.

This was a well-done course, especially considering it was the first time they'd taught an online course, much less this one. I would be interested in taking another class by the same profs if the content overlapped with my interests and skill level when it was offered, and would even bend a bit on both to take a class with them."
288,"Absolutely incredible! Very polished; everything worked; some of the people who were total novices were able to complete all of the projects and those who were already experienced seemed to learn a great deal as well. The lectures were quite good; there were many demonstrations of what we were studying provided; the quizzes were definitely learning experiences rather than just ""tests""; and the projects were absolutely great! I roped in some of my friends as ""testers"" for my projects; they weren't picky enough to be good testers, but some of them and their children are still enjoying the games I built. And at least 2 of them are interested enough to try to get into the class that's being offered in the spring. I just can't think of enough superlatives to adequately describe this experience."
289,"At first I was a bit skeptical about whether these guys could pull this off. I've taken other programming languages and do quite a bit of programming already, however I was really interested in the focus on interactive programming and game development.

I've never really liked on-line courses because I've often felt that they were too inpersonal and often dull. Oh boy was I wrong! This class was one of the best courses I've ever taken both online and in college. The instructors did an amazing job in keeping the class fresh, entertaining, and easy to understand.

My point here is that if you want to learn to code or if you already know but want to learn about interactive programming or game programming. You need to take this class. You won't regret it! These guys, as goofy as they are, are amazing!"
290,"I took this class and has a great experience. I think I'm different from a lot of the people who took the class in that I didn't come in with an extensive programming background. I got hired by a company to be a programmer although my only previous experience was building websites & writing SQL queries. I had to teach myself programming (in ASP and VBScript) and I wanted to expand my languages.

The reason I'm saying that is to point out this was my first class to ever take for a programming language and I'm not an expert programmer. Yet, I got a lot from the class. I felt the teaching technique and speed were very good. It was a great experience and I'd recommend it to anyone, even an experienced programmer like myself, as a great way to expand their skills and learn more about the programming world."
291,"This course was amazing! I started out with absolutely no programming knowledge (outside of some basic HTML and CSS) and finished it feeling like I could build a simple game of my own design using the knowledge and experience I had gained in just 8 weeks.

Yes, it was challenging. Every project pushed me to the edge of almost quitting, but I persevered and had a break-through moment every time.

The faculty managed to explain complicate concepts in a straightforward manner, the course was well planned, and the support for people like me who kept running into mental brick walls (from both the faculty and other students on the course forums) was amazing!

I cannot recommend this course highly enough, and I'll definitely be signing up again if this team decides to run an intermediate Python course."
292,"I completed this class. This class is awesome!

This class takes people from no programming experience to being able to make Pong, a Blackjack game, and a spaceship game (with shooting rockets, sound, animated explosions). Prepare to be challenged, though, don't give up at the difficult spots--you've got to use the cycle of--read requirements, draw or write it out/brainstorm in English, psuedocode, code, test piece of code, ... Sometimes it takes a day of sleeping on it to resolve the tough problems. Definitely worth it.

A big thanks to professors Scott, Joe, and John. They have some funny videos of friendly competition between Scott and Joe which are entertaining--will they be wearing a tie next week? :-)

Really surprised at how much I've learned in a short time and thankful for this free class."
293,"This is a fun class, well organized, with lots of support for learning in the form of an IDE (CodeSkulptor) in which to develop the programs, with links to Python documentation and practice problems, discussion forums, and quizzes. The class and material are well-paced and the unifying theme is games. Every week includes about two hours of video lectures, two quizzes, a programming project, and peer assessments. A template is provided for each programming project, so that helps structure the code. The forums are very active, and it is easy to get help and clarifications. The peer assessments also help you learn from your online classmates. I highly recommend this class if you would like to learn a leading scripting language and application of object-oriented programming concepts in a supportive environment."
294,"An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python is a wonderful course. The presentation of the topics is interesting and fun. I love teacher’s sense of humor it always make me smile and want to learn more. The course is for beginners but that doesn’t mean is easy all the time. There are some challenging ideas but teachers give you all the tools that you need to get it and all the effort you are going to put in understanding them is worth it. And when you finally make your own game, that works and looks really good, the satisfaction you will feel is unbelievable. After this course I realize that I want to be a programmer and it was the first step towards my new career. It was a great journey and I recommend it to all of you who want to learn Python in a more fun and a little challenging way."
295,"Joe Warren and Scott Rixner have built a fantastic class that covers several topics and seamlessly weaves them together to build fun, interactive games! The course covers:

1) Programming with Python

2) The event-driven programming paradigm

3) Game development

4) A little on the object orientation paradigm

If you have some experience in another programming language, the class will be relatively easy, but loads of fun. If you're new to programming, the class will be challenging but very rewarding and totally doable if you're willing to commit the time. The professors have really built the class with those new to programming in mind but somehow manage not to neglect the more experienced folks.

I was amazed at the programs I built in this class and can't wait to explore more with Python."
296,"A terrific intro to Python programming.

Rice University (Scott Rixner) has programmed a web interpreter for Python called CodeSkulptor that makes it really easy to experiment, try things out, and run your programs from any platform. It can even function as a single-step emulator/debugger.

Combining the CodeSkulptor platform, with a series of interesting and progressive projects, and a good organization of the Python programming topics, you also get a group of Rice professors (Joe Warren, Scott, and John Greiner) who, while sometimes a bit geekish, really have fun teaching, and it's a pleasure learning from them.

Only downside - no text; my own notes are now my Python reference work. (On the other hand, perhaps making me write, edit, and reorganize my own reference book helped me learn!)"
297,"I've started the course knowing nothing about programming. Three weeks have passed now (the course is supposed to last for 9 weeks, but I was fast:), and I would like to say that I am more than pleased with the class. The professors are incredibly nice and fun; they explain the material clearly and in a way that won't let you get bored. Each week you're doing a mini-project, usually a game, which sometimes includes some troubles, but you can figure it out eventually (if you're completely stuck you can get help in the forum or by e-mailing the instructors, but I never had to use that). The feeling that you can create something is truly joyful (every time I finished making a game I was crying out OH MY IT'S WORKING I'VE GOT THE POWER :) I do recommend this course to those wanting to learn Python!"
298,"I came to this class with 2 university programing courses as background, and even though I wasn't exactly the target audience, I was completely fascinated by it, and I think I've learned a lot.

The Graphical interaction with the user is quite different, and it is a lot more enjoyable way to program than what is usually passed in introductory courses in computer science.

The instant feedback allows for easy bug tracing and fixing, and provides the feeling of ""I'm creating something real"".

I think this is great for both complete beginners, that may learn to love computer science, and ""semi experienced"" programmers, like me.

Python, by the way, is an excellent programing language. very very productive.

a small amount of code can make a lot of things happen."
299,"This course is well made. The professors brought me countless knowledge and joy. Weekly lessons are carefully prepared and the entire semester is well organized. The professor even wrote a web-based version of the python integrated development environment specifically for this course, which shows that they have worked hard for this course. After the end of each week, a mini game project will be used as the assessment standard. It will well test and consolidate the knowledge you have learned in the lesson. Before the mini project is started, the teachers will be happy to demonstrate the game for you and let You experience the joy of programming in joy.
Thanks to Joe Warren and Professor Scott Rixner for their contributions. If you want to learn python, this course is worth learning."
300,"As a beginning python programmer coming from the GIS world, I was a bit unprepared for the kind of mindset it requires to program games. Nonetheless, Joe and Scott are amazing and supportive teachers who lead me all the way through to quite an advanced level without much frustration, and in fact mostly leveraging the power of pure problem-solving. They gave all the tools necessary for each assignment and let us simply find our way.

The one suggestion I'd have would be the timing of assignment deadlines. As one who works a full workweek, I usually get started on the weekend on assignments, and it's very difficult to complete everything in one day for the Saturday night deadline. If something can be done to remedy this madness, I would be very appreciative for next time."
301,"Being a psychologist I have had no contact with math or science-related classes since high-school. But programming has always been intriguing to me. Now, at 38, I took ""An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"" and I had so much fun with it that I'm thinking of changing careers! (Back to earth) The projects were the most fascinating part. Going every week through ""phases"" of doing the easy stuff-trying the hard ones-frustration-more frustration-exasperation-idea!-solution-satisfaction I cannot describe! The teachers were excellent, they seem to love what they do and they are great teachers. The work they have put to make this work and to help us understand the pronciples and build on them is remarkable."
302,"As an older (pushing 50) woman who grew up never even dreaming of learning to program anything let alone a video game, I highly, highly recommend this class. It is structured logically in a way that enables you to build on your learning to do what seems impossible. Moreover, the instructors clearly enjoy teaching and are active in the discussion forums, and they also clearly like each other, so that the whole program feels like a safe and friendly place to try new things and learn. There is also an excellent group of Community TAs who not only help out in the discussion forums but also have produced their own supplemental videos etc. to provide additional support for those of us who need it. I cannot recommend this course highly enough."
303,"This course was extremely engaging, not boring at all, but still taught a lot of technical concepts. If I hadn't already been interested in coding, this course is definitely structured in a way that will get you quickly hooked on programming. As with most things in life, you'll get out of the course what you put into the course. There were times I spent hours tweaking some small feature of a program until I had it just the way I wanted it, or added features that weren't required just because I wanted my program to be that way. So yes, I put in extra time, however, I also feel that doing some of these extras also really drove the concepts home and I completed the course with the belief that I can continue in this discipline with confidence and competence. Thanks guys!"
304,"I thought Joe, Scott and their colleagues did a great job. Once you get through the first couple of weeks they start getting into OOP and classes. They made it relatively straight-forward to get the basics and I hear they are planning to further strengthen this component. You do not need to be an avid gamer to do this course - the games for me were simply a fun way of demonstrating programming concepts. You do need to work though and if you are coming in without huge experience the 7-9 hours a week may be a shade optimistic for some of the more advanced projects. I hope the team at Rice continue to invest the time to further develop these classes, a more advanced class would be very welcome - an emphasis on interactive Python and databases would be really useful."
305,"I had so much fun taking this course! And besides that, I also learned a lot, which makes it even better ofcourse.
Because all the assignments are games, like Pong and Asteroids, it is fun to work on them. You are really motivated to stick with it and finish the assignments, because afterwards you can play your own games. Since you're working in a specially built online environment, you can share your games easily with friends and family.
One of the best things was the fun the instructors were having with the class. This made the video lectures very enjoyable to watch, and encouraged an open and friendly environment, with an active community on the forums where students help each other out and start new projects together.
I highly recommend taking this course!"
306,"Excellent explanations and practical implementations of theory into practice through the mini projects. The concepts are explained with the aim of allowing us to build upon them outside of the course. I can honestly say that I feel like the course serves as a solid foundation upon which I can keep building my knowledge.

The use of CodeSkulptor (a browser based programming environment) was another excellent feature that sets this course apart, I could jump straight into practicing without needing to install and configure random software.

Lastly, the professors are knowledgeable, humorous and easy to understand. They do an excellent job of explaining concepts in simple terms and guiding you through the learning experience.

I would highly recommend the course."
307,"Great course for beginners who have the time to put into it each week. Experienced programmers would be better off with a more self-paced method, as it moves somewhat slowly, but new programmers will enjoy it and can ramp up quickly.

The course features an online code interpreter/compiler so no download is necessary, which makes taking the course a breeze. The discussion forums are full of helpful people, including course TAs and sometimes even the instructors. There are many resources, such as practice problems, a code clinic or the forums so getting stuck isn't a problem.

For a beginner programming course it's fantastic to learn with such an easy-to-use language and the course takes you up to implementing classes. I would highly recommend this course."
308,"I am an ancient engineer, who hadn't programmed in years. I heard about Coursera from my (non-techie) daughters, visited the site, and I don't know why I chose this Class (maybe because it was starting soon!). But boy, am I glad I did!

I had so much fun coding those games, and I learnt a bit about OOP in the bargain.

The videos were good, and the professors were knowledgeable and humorous. Scott's CodeSkulptor was an amazing, hassle-free, ready-to-use environment where we could just dive right in!

I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn programming, or who already knows a language and wants to learn Python.

And I am waiting for the next course from these professors....Thanks Scott and Joe (and who can forget John's dead-pan tips?)!"
309,"Incredible job considering there are no entry criteria for the course. It was obvious from the forum there was a massive cross section of skills from experienced programmers to absolute beginners.

The lecturers somehow managed to keep the information basic enough for the beginners whilst making the tasks interesting enough to keep the more experienced people happy too. Such a difficult task but as far as I can see, wonderfully executed. It was also marvelous that the more experienced helped out the less experienced. Without the forums I would imagine that the course would have collapsed. But it didn't and although I struggled at times I knew I'd find a hint somewhere on the forum or by going back over the video lectures.

Top notch course. Well done!"
310,"I really enjoyed taking this course and i hope all of you who are interested in programming in python will start it.
All three of the teachers are really patient, they explain a concept over and over if it's more new or more complicated and if you put a little effort you can easily finish this course and also acumulate a lot of information.
The course is 8 weeks long and at the end of every week you must program some kind of game(this is the part where the information learned throught the week gets ""fixed""). The teacher give you a a couple of steps and advices to make implementing the game easier and you also have forums to ask about something.
Finally this is the best programming course I have taken so far and I hope you will appreciate it as much as I do."
311,"I had only very basic programming experience going into this course. It was at a perfect level and pace for me to make it all the way through. The lecturers are all very clear and helpful both during lectures and on the class forums where problems are discussed. The 7-9 hours a week guideline may be a little on the high side, but by the end of the course the assignments will begin to challenge you and take more of your time. Do not let this dissuade you though. At the end of 8 weeks, there is no substitute to the feeling of achievement when you have a spaceship zooming around your very own game, blowing up asteroids. I am incredibly grateful that this course was available to me and the skills I gained will be useful for me in the future. Top marks!"
312,"This is real; you listen to lectures, do quizzes, which really are homework problems, and do programming projects. You learn Python and you learn event driven programming. Actual programming of games starts immediately: they get more mileage out simple programming constructs then I would have guessed possible. They motivate every concept they teach by making you use it immediately to create a game. The programming projects, in sequence, make palpable the effectiveness of object oriented programming; with properly conceived classes and methods, programs falls together with remarkable ease.

For 8 weeks you work hard and learn a lot and it sticks with you. You find yourself looking forward to each new lecture, quiz, and programming project."
313,"As an experienced programmer and IT consultant for over 25 years, my goals were to add a new language to the toolbox, to dabble in game development and to evaluate the usefulness of online courses.

I was very pleased with the quality of the instructors and the tremendous amount of preparation that had gone into this class. The development environments, mini-projects and videos were very well done.

The course was very fast paced, but the quizzes and mini-projects could easily be completed in 4-8 hours per week.

This experience has been a great introduction to xMOOC courses and I will definitely look for more classes like this and also more classes from Warren and Rixner (if Joe will promise to wear a tie)

314,"I can't tell you how much fun I had in this class. Early on, when one of our friends saw my versions of Blackjack and Pong. she said, ""When the neighborhood kids see that you are programming computer games, you'll be the most popular adult in town"". She was right. :-)

This is no where near the most difficult thing that we did in the class BUT ... when I put the RiceRocks spaceship together step by step ... I put the spaceship image in the center of the canvas, added forward motion, added the thrust sound, and finally changed the spaceship image to the spaceship image with flames popping out the the rear, I just sat back and said ""OMG ... This is sooooooooooooooo cool!!!""

Thanks you ... Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen! RICE ROCKS!"
315,"From a novice programmer with desires to attend a Masters Program in Computational Mathematics:

I thoroughly enjoyed this course and now feel confident enough in my Python programming skills to write complete and functioning programs.

I currently work as a Business Systems Analyst for an Energy Trading Firm and already these skills have proven to be valuable in my day to day work.

The class is challenging and fun at the same time. I have previously take 3 other online programming classes and have learned more through this course than the first 3 combined.

I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to explore the world of Python for the first time and even some expert programmers looking to broaden their skill set."
316,"Both parts of this course were amazing. I work in a psychology lab where we use python-programmed experiments. I took other python courses to better understand this experiments but it was this one that helped me out the most. The other courses I took were not interactive; they just taught you how to use python to read files and that kind of stuff. This was so different and, in my opinion, so much better. I really leaned A LOT in mere two months, and the teachers are all great. Not only are they crystal clear when explaining, but they also make the class very entertaining. The mini-projects are engaging to complete, and you really feel satisfied when you get them done.
I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about programming."
317,"This is a fantastic way to learn Python, while simultaneously getting exposed to Event-driven and Object Oriented Programming.

Their approach of having the student build a new game each week is engaging and satisfying. I was initially concerned that the instructors were making things too easy by working through the most challenging issues for each assignment in the videos or in the templates. However eventually this allowed me to complete much more polished projects and developed the confidence to tackle more ambitious projects in future. They have managed to strike the perfect balance with this course.

I would take another course with these instructors in a heartbeat. Highly recommended if you are just getting started with Python."
318,"It was my very first experience with programming and it was just great. I would never believe that I would be able to make quite a complex program in just a few weeks.

There are provided video lectures and a lot of other materials, also discussion forums work pretty well and there are even other ways which can help you to go through if you stuck on something. It is well structured and organised and the course leads you on the way of programming just amazingly. I've got really excited about programming so even though my profession is completely different, I just found a new hobby which is not only fun but hell of useful.

Beside that teachers are really great, they are both experts and superb lecturers. And they're really fun."
319,"Well organized class. No programming experience required, however good math skills make it easier to deal with the tasks in the early part of the course.

The pace started out at a comfortable walk, but quickly accelerated once basic concepts were instilled. Each week the videos covered new material in a fun approach. By the end of week 8, the mini project Rice Rocks (an asteroids game) was within reach based on skills learned during the course.

I found the programming concepts discussed in John Greiner's videos to be the most helpful part of the instruction. The discussion forums were a good place to observe what type of difficulties others were encountering and learning additional techniques for solving tricky parts."
320,"I've just completed this course and can highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in learning to programme. Although titled as an introduction to programming be prepared to put in some serious effort and get some amazing results. If you stick with it, by the end of the course you will have gained a good working knowledge of event driven programming, object oriented programming, and you will have written code for some cool games.

The material is really well presented but you're definitely not spoon-fed.

Prior to this I had practically no knowledge of programming, none is necessary to take the course. It was definitely challenging at times, but absolutely worth it. If you're considering such a course, look no further."
321,"This was an exceptional class to take. It taught python in a really fun and exciting way that encouraged programming by using creative projects, rather then dull, boring programs. The instructors were energetic and engaging, and were quite active in the forums. Which is really helpful. Looking back, there was a huge amount of material covered in a short amount of time, but it was always presented in a clear, and logical progression, that it never became a problem.

Great course. definitely a must for anyone who has an interest in programming or video games, or who knows programming, and wants to learn the python language.

Thank you, Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong, for a fun experience."
322,"The content of the course was just right - not too difficult to give up, but challenging enough to be so happy to complete each mini-project. I absolutely respect them for building Code Skulptor as a tool to write code in, especially Visualization mode, very useful, got me out of some huge troubles. Instructors are just great. Nice English (so that non-native speakers can understand easily), funny, very clear explanation, and the mini-project assignments (and step by step instructions as well) were very smart and great fun to work on as well. Everything worked well at Coursera background too. I am very, very thankful for this course. I went from knowing almost nothing to being dangerous while having a great time."
323,"Loved the class. This was my 4th coding class and my 1st online class. After taking previous courses in college, vowed never to take a programming class again. On the other hand, after having taken Python I am enthused and thinking of next step re continuing Python education. Class was fun, assignments addictive, Profs, TAs and peers very supportive. An absolute beginner would find this class very difficult - many novice coders dropped the class. However, if you are a novice, my advice is to take this course, anyway - twice. Audit it the first time, do your own off-line work. Then take class again for credit. That is how highly I think of class. This is one of the best ways get into programming. Good luck."
324,"This class was pure awesome-sauce!

I've done a few MOOCs now, on different programming and CS subjects and this has to have been the one I found the most entertaining and encouraging. I had the principles of the class material down before starting, so I didn't find it too challenging, but I would very strongly recommend it to someone looking to get started with programming in general or Python in particular.

What I did learn was a lot about the principles of using a GUI and event driven programming, which I have less experience with.

Would I recommend this class to a friend? Absolutely! Probably even without them asking me too. :) In fact, I want more!

More classes like this, please chaps!"
325,"A great class. Recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn Python.

That fact that I failed has nothing to do with the class content or the way it was structured. I missed the boat a few times and struggled afterwards. But till the end I enjoyed watching the videos because they are very instructive. The way the course is set out enthuses you. And above all I still learned a lot.

Eventhough I am not a gamer the fact that the whole teaching is based on creating games is excellent. I enjoyed it. Because it deals with many concepts that are very useful in a playful way.

As I said before I highly recommend, and already have done so, this course for anyone who wants an introduction into Python."
326,"Having learned the fundamentals of Python previously I see this class as a big step in direction of deepening program design skills and divining into the GUI programming world. It's not the best place to start though, cs101 Udacity experience like Python syntax and data structures is needed if you want to concentrate on object-oriented and event-driven aspects of the course. Professors present the basics pretty good, but you will definitely want some related practice before jumping to course mini-projects. While peer-reviewing the work of the fellow students I found many traces of struggling with basics in assignments, so some prior knowledge will make your experience in this class much more pleasant."
327,"This is a great introduction to Python and programming in general. The projects are focused on interaction and creating games. It's a lot of work and a lot to learn if you are new to python and programming. But it's taught very well and kept engaging. The course projects are excellent and you should definitely do the practice exercises to get the most out of the class.

After completing this class, I'm a lot more confident in my understanding of object oriented programming, which is a big deal. It's kind of amazing when your code works. This class was challenging for me, but there were enough resources to get through it. The challenge level was good though, because I feel like I grew and learned so much."
328,"Well explained video-lectures with subtitles available. A very active forum to get help. Interesting and fun.

I took this course with a little background on programming and had no problem following the lectures. Maybe people with no programming experience at all will find it harder to follow, but there is a great Forum to ask for help. The Forum is very active and everybody, students and teachers, read and answer the topics.

The course is oriented at programming games, to make it fun to learn. This is not exactly what I'm interested in, but it was fun and I think it is good to learn how to code in Python, even if you are not expecting to build games with the knowledge you get in the course."
329,"During this course I learned object-oriented and event-driven programming with a little previous knowledge of Python (I only used it as a Matlab replacement with the numpy and matplotlib modules).

The course is based on the usage of their proprietary simpleGUI library on a web browser, but now I'm moving to GTK+ and thanks to their effort I can at least understand the tutorial. They do their best in keeping you awake during the lessons which are quite funny, you'll miss their faces after completing the course.

I'd like to thank prof. Rixner, prof. Warren, prof. Greiner and prof. Wong for their contribution in making the world a better place along with Coursera. Your work is much appreciated."
330,"This is by far the best programming class I have ever taken. This course takes object oriented programming beyond showing you how to create objects. You actually create object classes and re-use them in making games. If you are struggling to understand OO programming this course is a must. You will have that ""ah-ha!"" moment where everything suddenly makes sense. I started writing code without much effort. I finally feel like becoming a proficient programmer is an obtainable goal. The guys who created this class make the videos a lot of fun too. None of that mind numbing, tooth picks in the eyelids, material you find in many programming video tutorials. I cannot recommend this course enough!"
331,"It is amazing to think that a course of this caliber is free to everyone with an internet connection. I cannot imagine a more effective tool for learning programming basics and rudimentary game programming skills than this course. The material of the course is extremely well thought-out, and progresses slowly and steadily throughout the two months duration. I fully appreciate the time and effort put into creating this course, and I think that this course raises the bar on what is possible with a MOOC. I sincerely hope that more advanced courses on programming are taught with this style. We are all fortunate to have the opportunity to take this class. Thanks Rixner, Warren, Greiner, and Wong!"
332,"After many decades of learning and using programming, this is my first massively online course. As an introduction to yet another new programming language, this was very easy and enjoyable. Using games as examples keeps it interesting but also very understandable. None of the learning of Python was obscured by the examples, which is a problem that seem to happen a lot in other introductory programing classes. The Rice Rocks game is amazingly good, and it is a confidence builder to have done it in this class. Even as someone very experienced in other programming languages, I found this course interesting and informative, which means that even with experience I learned a lot from this course."
333,"This was a fantastic course! The videos were well done and the forums were extremely helpful. The best part was the projects, which were designed to be progressively more challenging while incorporating both old and new material from the course videos. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn how to program in Python. It is probably best if you have some exposure to programming prior to diving in; it is a beginner level course, but the pace may be a bit fast for someone who has never programmed at all. That said, it's a free course, so if you think you are ready, feel free to dive in and see if it's for you! I am extremely glad I took this course! Well worth the time!"
334,"This was the first Cousera course that I felt that I got more out of than I put into. Codeskulpter, while annoyingly lost everything when I hit F5 because I was used to doing that to run my code (totally my fault btw), was very easy to use and easy to share with my friends when I made a game and I could get feedback rather quickly. The teachers liked to have fun and Joe looks like he is related to Quinton Tarantino. Great Python beginners course, maybe coming from a Codecademy course. If you know Python but not any GUI, then it is still very useful, you just might think there is too much time between assignments. But that's good if you are as busy as I am. This class leaves me wanting more."
335,"A great introduction to object oriented programming for noobs or programmers who, like me, have only ever built scripts and engineering programs. The course comprises a series of lecture videos and projects where the student designs a small game. The videos are short and engaging, and presented with large dollops of extremely corny humour. The projects have been carefully designed to reinforce the concepts presented that week in the videos.

The course may not tax you that much intellectually, but the presenters have really gone to a great deal of effort to appeal to as large an audience as possible. My only criticism of the course is that it ended because it really was loads of fun."
336,"I agree with all the praise this course gets from the other commenters. It is a well designed course which teaches important programming concepts in a way that is us fun and rewarding. Usually a coding framework is provided and you fill in your code as needed. That way you just focus on learning specific segments of programming in an organized way.

It's not just about games. The games make it fun and rewarding. You get a cool game you can email to your friends and impress them ;) , but your are at the same time learning real-world, useful programming techniques.

I really enjoyed this course and feel I now have a firm foundation and understanding of python programming. I give it an A+."
337,"Personally, I am an IT student in Greece and I just wanted to learn Python programming language because I cannot learn it from my university. However, this class taught me more than the particular language. The instructors introduced me into various intriguing aspects of programming I haven't seen before.

Teaching OOP to beginners is very challenging, especially with Python which is not established object-oriented language. But Scott, Joe and John managed to walk us through the world of OOP successfully.

I never regretted taking this course and neither will you, honestly!

PS: There were funny moments during the lectures, especially with Scott. He has a great taste of humour."
338,"I can not think of a better introduction to programming or Python class than this one. You can really tell the instructors have spent a tremendous amount of time and effort in putting together the course material and refining it over time. The instructional videos are put together well with a good sense of humor keeping you engaged, fully preparing you for the quizzes and mini-projects.

I took this class as it is a part of a learning curriculum from my employer along with Part 2. I've been so impressed with the instructors that I've already signed up for the follow-up classes 'Principles of Computing' even though it's not a required course for me. I know I'm going to learn and these guys do an excellent job in teaching."
339,"I took many online classes out there to learn how to code, but never really managed to get a real grasp of how to really code.

This class changed everything ! You learn a language, of course, but much more importantly, you learn how to program, how to think, how to create a program from scratch ! You learn the process of thinking and creation behind programming ! I now feel comfortable going out there and learning so much more, because I learned how to do it !

Additionnaly, the class material is very qualitative, the assignments are a ton of fun (and a bit of a headache sometimes ;)) and the teachers are remarkable. They love what they do and they just manage to pass in onto you.

Couldn't thank them enough !!"
340,"Best MOOC class I have taken - regardless of subject!

Huge amount of supporting material with a student community that did a lot to help one another.

Instructors did a good job of pacing the material.

Best of all was the grading system. Instead of having a computer grade your work they use a peer assessment/review process. I was skeptical at first - however I found that reviewing other students work helped me to learn more about Python and different ways to solve the same problem.

I would highly recommend this course to anyone new to programming or with experience in another language that is looking to move to Python.

Looking forward to seeing what they come up with to offer next!"
341,"This is a brilliant course.

The structure of is very conducive to good learning. It has 3-6, 12 minute (approx) videos per week with two well structured quizzes per week that really make you think and tease out the things you did not really understand.

It provides an excellent code editing/ execution environment, CodeSkulptor, with a great deal of built in documentation including example and a very useful Graphical User Interface.

There are supporting discussion forums, exercises and useful links.

But above all each week there is a mini project which is great fun and helps consolidate the knowledge you have gained so far. Take the course. You won't regret it."
342,"The course is simply great: I think that everyone, from beginners to programmers that what to approach python in a fun way, will appreciate it. Videos are always nice: easy to follow but never boring, quizzes help fixing the concepts encouraging to try out things and mini projects with games to be implemented are super. The guides to develop them are really useful and help novices with step by step suggestions. All the instructors are fantastic and I agree that we need to see more of prof. Greiner and code style / programming tips videos. I keep suggesting people IRL to try out this course because I strongly believe that it would be useful and fun in many different situations."

344,"I always had trouble to make the things pratical. Ok, I knew how to use lists, piles and lines and I knew how to find a number, organize, delete etc, but with this class I finally could make things happen. The first time that I made a button at the canvas I was so happy and things got really natural after that huge step in my life.

The class is great, I had a lot of suport with extra materials and I would like to make a special thanks for Joe and Scott. You are great, you teached me a lot and you also made me laught a lot. You are an inspiration (I study engineer and I love to teach as well) for me and I really hope to thank you personally someday. See you in the next course!"

346,"I took this course with no formal programming training. I was not especially interested in learning how to program games - I just wanted to learn to program in Python and needed a structured environment. This course more than fit the bill. It was challenging, but doable for a non-programmer. After completing the course, I feel I have a good foundation to build on, even though I don't plan to develop games. The instructors were very personable and enthusiastic about their course, so the video lectures were watchable and even entertaining - definitely not dry/boring. And while I said I'm not much into games, building games as the mini-projects did add an element of fun."
347,"Excellent class. I especially appreciated the CodeSkulptor web-based programming environment, which allowed us to jump right into programming without the hassle of installing our own IDE and GUI library. The templates that Joe Warren provided gave us a good start. John Greiner's programming tips were great and filled in some of the gaps in Prof. Warren's code, which didn't always follow strict Python/OOP conventions. Both Warren and Rixner do a great job of explaining concepts. We didn't see very much of Prof. Wong, but it is my understanding that he made substantial contributions behind the scenes. I hope this great programming team offers more classes in the future."
348,"I'm a professional developer, who uses Java and C languages. So I wanted to get acquainted with Python. Instructors of this class made tremendous work of teaching the basics of Pythons in very joyful, yet very helpful way.

I highly recommend this course to those who don't even have any programming experience. It will be right course for you. There's so many help everywhere: good explanation in video lectures, hints in quizzes, very detailed instructions in mini-projects and good examples in Practice Exercises section.

Thanks again to the instructors: Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner and Stephen Wong. And also to the Rice University for providing such course!"
349,"The contents of the course is good. I really like the way you organized it. Quizzes and assignments really polish us. If we do not pick anything from the lectures then Q/A helps us understand those gaps. After taking this course I am highly motivated to take more courses to further excel my skills. Particularly, I want to take the course designed on scripting because in m work I need to know this part. So I just finished this course and since I am fully satisfied therefore I am going to register my self in another course on scripting with python, taught by the same instructors!!!!!

Well done and thank you to the instructors and the ppl working behind the screen!"
350,"Although this was the very first MOOC class I attended, I have much experience in university-level courses. I teach C programming at University of L'Aquila. I am an experienced programmer but

I decided to attend the class to learn Python and to know more about interactive programming.

I didn't expect to be so impressed by the quality of pedagogy.

This is really an excellent course for beginners, the contents are challenging but not too complex to let down who has no experience. The material was also very fun, and this helps a lot.

The course is also useful for experienced programmers that don't know Python or the event-driven paradigm.

I recommend it."
351,"I think it was impressive how the professors took a subject that can be boring to beginners and did their BEST to make it fun and interactive. I really enjoyed the mini-projects. Teaching programming through video-game design is an AWESOME idea! I had lots of fun creating the games and I really got a sense of accomplishment having completed the course. This was my first time actively programming video games, and using OOP and the professors made it lost of fun! I also really enjoyed the video lectures, they were entertaining but informative. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning python, no matter what your level of programming is!"
352,"This was an excellent class, with detailed engaging videos, quizzes to test concepts, and well-presented programming projects to use the language.

Each programming assignment included a template and a design framework. These really helped to guide development and help assure success.

The development environment (CodeSkulptor) made starting up super easy and assured that everyone have a very similar experience creating the assignment.

The instructors were clear, knowledgeable and very well prepared. It was clear that they enjoyed working together, and helping the class. The videos were short but very pointed and complete.

Very highly recommended!!"
353,"Excellent way to dive into object oriented program. I'd never seen it before, and hadn't hit a lick programming in 15 years,and then only one course...and no followup usage. Here, the instrution is terrific, and there are enough pros in the discussion forums to get you through the tough spots. Then if all else fails, the instructors will field your code and give you more direction. Expect to work but how else do you learn. I'd hope these professors will move on to other courses so we can benefit from their knowledge and enthusiasm. Those who finished this course know what a thrill it was to run the code in that last game, and see those explosions work!."
354,"I found the class to be a lot of fun even though I have programmed before. The homework was fun to do and of course seeing an end result like blackjack or Asteroids is always a plus. I do recommend this class to programmers and beginners.

I do recommend you make sure you have enough time to set aside to take the course if you have never programmed before, have weak math skills or have trouble with logically thinking through problems. If you find you have weak points in any of these areas it may take significantly more than the 7-9 hours stated in the description but this should not disuade you from taking the course, it may help you fix those weak points."

356,"By taking this class, I've learnt to write games that my son rates very highly.

I finally managed to grasp the concept of Object Oriented Programming after 15 years of dabbling, which has resulted in writing a playingcards module for writing other card games. The feedback from the peer review grading system helped greatly with improving the games and the code.

The interaction in the discussion forums, which was also monitored by the lecturers, is a valuable resource, especially from highly skilled and helpful students such as Jan Grant.

Finally, the CourseRa delivery platform helps to make the course content highly engaging.

I'm extremely grateful.

Potts"
357,"This is a fantastic course in many ways: (1) the topics and the mini-projects are such that each small amount of effort results in a lot of learning, (2) the course starts at a very basic level and gets into non-trivial territory very smoothly, (3) the lectures are crystal clear, (4) the projects are very instructive, and (5) it is a really fun way to learn many interesting things!

Taking this course without any previous exposure to programming may be a bit challenging after the first few weeks, but given how well everything is done, the course is definitely not hard.

It was a real pleasure to take this class. Bravo Joe, Scott, John (and Stephen?)!"
358,"To wrap up in short: this class is amazing. Everything from my perspective was the best learning experience I've had in my life. Although some people might rise an issue about ""spoon feeding"" with so many details given but having in mind that this is an introductory course and I (like lots of other people) had no programming experience before, I think it is well planned out. It helps you to understand the basics of these principles in programming with python. If left to figure it out alone (like game physics and some logic behind it using a programming language), that would be unnecessarily more challenging for a complete beginner in programming. Superb work."
359,"If you're interested in learning how to program, you have to take this course.
This is by far the best course in programming that I have ever taken and I was a computer science major many years ago. Now, I have my advanced 5th and 6th graders work through this course so I need to take it to be able to help them. Yes, this course is so well-done that a bright grade-schooler can take it. One great thing about this course is that the instructors use exercises and quizzes to take you step by step to the skills that you need to build the game you are writing for a project that week. If you're a teacher, take this course to see what great teaching looks like."
360,"AMAZING course and staff!

Python is great but these guys are better... this course is a must for anyone interested in programming.

http://youtu.be/O1X9BIMz03c

(no code included!!!)

This is my version of Ricerocks, the final project for Rice University (An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python).

I call it 'RiceWars' (a little bit of Ricerocks plus a taste of Star Wars)

It's all in Python & Pygame.

I really hope you enjoy it. Looking forward to your comments!

Take care all of you,

Mario

You can download it from link in youtube page.

(contains installation .exe file, if your windows security is having issues, just choose RUN ANYWAY)"
361,"Take this class.

You will learn huge amounts about coding Python for an interactive game environment..

You will have a lot of fun and get a great deal of self-satisfaction and confidence in your ability to learn something new.

This class sets the standard for all other MOOCs. The instructors are engaging; the videos, practice exercises, and quizzes are all relevant to each other each week; the mini-projects are so exciting and rewarding when you f-i-n-a-l-l-y get that game working. There is a terrific sense of camaraderie within the discussion forums where we all want to encourage each other to succeed and be the best we each can be."
362,"I would give more stars if I could.

Taking this class was an amazing experience. So far it's the best programming class I've ever taken. The team headed by professors Warren and professor Rixner put together a very well thought class. Going from basic concepts to the full development of a complete clone of the classic game Asteroids, you receive all the help possible and more to succeed.

Expect to be challenged; you will spend lots of hours working on weekly miniproyects, but the rewards of seeing the end results will be worth it.

I strongly recomend this class to everybody, beginers and experts alike; you will be truly surprised!"
363,"After attending half a dozen coursera courses about computer sciences in the last year, this course is definitely the best course with respect to the well thought thru teaching material, the carefully crafted mini projects of OO programming, which made the dauntfull task of OO thinking a really enjoyable experience. Joe and Scott put a lot of effort into the didactics of the course, the peer grading with its unambiguous rubrics, the quizzes including explanations and last but not least their skill to make a course fun to watch and learn. Coursera should take this course as a benchmark for CS courses. Looking forward to some advanced course :)"
364,"This class, as opposed to many other introductory courses, offers a glimpse of what is possible with fluency in a programming language; showing a glimpse of the forest rather than focusing on the trees. The instructors provide tools that allow students with no prior experience to create fully functional, fun games within a few weeks. Their sense of joy in programming is infectious. It's clear they're committed to teaching MOOCs effectively, leaving no one behind. I've studied CS topics on and off for decades and this is the first time I've felt inspired to actually *build* anything on my own. Well worth the time I spent- highly recommended to all."
365,"It's hard to believe this was free. The professors put an incredible amount of time into making the interface that could get beginners started, did a good job with the videos, and spent a lot of time helping students on the forums who were stuck.

It was also nice that other students who were taking the course offered so much help to newbies like me.

My piece of advice if you want to take this course, don't wait until the project deadlines like I always did. If you don't have a Python expert you can ask personally, get started early on the projects so that if you get stuck you have time to post your questions on the forums and get a response."
366,"It is an excellent course. Truly.

The pace of the course is well suited and you advance in the knowledge of Python progressively and very effectively. The video lessons are perfect: instructive and entertaining. In general, all course material is well suited.

The practical work (miniprojects) that we have done have been well planned and directed. It has the necessary level of difficulty to be achievable but without being too easy. In fact the entire program: video lessons, tests, assessments and projects, mainly, become addictive. You learn without realizing it.

It has been a pleasure to take the course and I had fun doing the miniprojects."
367,"it was a very good course, the only limiting factor was having to use CodeSkulptor. The only reason was because it is web based I was stuck with having to use a very small window to work with making it hard to see what was going on. I prefer to work in a desktop environment (like EDLE for example) where the working window can be enlarged to any size. I've seen CodeSculptor emulators but didn't have the patience to get them installed and working (the instructions suck). If CodeSkulptor could include an option to open the editor in another tab running full page that would be very helpful. By the eay this is a constant problem with all online IDEs."
368,"This is one of the best programming MOOCS I have taken. A very well designed course. The learning seems effortless in the beginning and can really get addictive and obsessive towards the end.

The CodeSkulptor, detailed, crystal clear feature specs, pseudocode, testing templates, objective rubrics all make the mini-projects absolutely enjoyable.

Many thanks to the instructors Joe and Scott. Thanks to all the other people who have contributed in the background.

I am very proud of what I have learnt and the games I could created in the process. As Scott had said in one of his videos, I am really showing them off to family and friends :-)"
369,"Very Good programming course .

It was very well structured and videos were so good that makes you comfortable .

About joe warren one of the intellectual lecturer i have ever seen he is so interactive it makes me intresting and put little more effort to complete the projects.

About Scott one of the most professional teacher who teaches wat's important for us wrt to industry.

Last but not the least programming tips were so helpful as i had used them in my actual code .

Thanks for this wonderfull course.

I enjoyed and improved my coding skills and I learnt Python as one of the good coding language.

Thanks

370,"The class is excellent for anyone who wants to learn python. The videos are good for introducing concepts.

Quizzes helped in clarifying some of the doubts. Sample programs were quite useful. Discussion forums were excellent. I wish they can expand the scope and teach more things. The class is more focused on creating games using python.

The thing which I didn't like is deadline for mini projects. The dead line should be extended for few more days.

Let’s say one week I am busy and not able to complete the mini project, I should get some time in next week to do that.

I would certainly recommend course to my friends.

Regards,"
371,"It's been 8 weeks of some nice teaching and also in a kind that hooks you up. It's not boring to listen to them, the way of teaching is also applicable in other programming languages too and also teaches you how to think over and solve a problem

I highly recommend this course to anyone either if he's a programmer or not of any level.

Forums were always helpful , either by looking for a solution to your problem you had or to help a fellow student. You could discuss your problems and find the answer to your problem and understand what you did wrong.

I will definitely look forward to another MOOC from Rice and especially the same team"
372,"This class was great. I've taken a few programming classes over the years and this one was the best by far. The lectures were interesting, and the projects were fun and challenging. Also, different from any other class I have taken were lectures from Prof. Greiner talking about more efficient ways to code. I can't recommend this class enough to potential students of all abilities. I wish I could attend Rice to take more classes from this group of professors.

I also want to thank the Professors that worked hard to put this class together. I am still wondering what the incentive was for them to do this, but it is very much appreciated."
373,"Extremely challenging class. The professors are extremely bright and hard-working. Forum support was great. Some decisions were made.... So that we could jump in and write appealing games, some stuff was glossed over or provided for us. I felt like some of the basics of programming were skipped. Recursion was not covered. Neither was inheritance or polymorphism. no Trees, linked lists, pointers. They encouraged the use of global variables when I had always been taught to avoid them..... But the tradeoff was that we were able to create some very advanced and polished games. Scott Rixner is an extraordinary professor. Highly recommended."
374,"The class is well-organized and well-taught. However, despite billing itself as an introductory course, students with little to no background in programming will find this course extremely challenging. I don't want to dissuade anyone from taking it; I think it will be very rewarding for anyone who learns the material and finishes the class. But I don't want anyone to be under the illusion that it will be easy. There are other Python courses out there that require less time and are easier, but I don't think they are anywhere near as fulfilling, either. If you want to learn Python and you enjoy a challenge, by all means go for it!"
375,"If you never new how to start programming or you tried on your own and failed (like i did) - this is the course i would recommend to you.

Python is a programming language which you can use on many platforms and for many tasks. It is an easy language from the semantic point of view.

The teachers are the funny and very clear in their descriptions. (My personal favorite is John Greiner. I watched his videos several times just because their are so funny. Ok, and because I needed to watch some of the scenes twice or more to understand)

Summary: If you are interested in programming, this is a very very good starting point!"
376,"A good introduction to Python well taught by video lectures and a wide range of examples and mini projects. A special bonus is that you don't need to download anything in order to write and run code as the CodeSkulptor tool allows you to do this. I could run this course from anywhere, practically, even in the locked down thin client environment at work.

The course tutors have a lightness of touch which makes some of the more challenging material less intimidating. If you get stuck, the discussion forums are a great help so you can usually solve your problem with a bit of help from others.

on the course.

Highly recommended"
377,"I'm an experienced programmer in Java and I also used to learn Python a little bit. So I knew that Python is a great language and it's worth learning it even if you are not planning to use it in your day-to-day work.

This class was a great experience and I must admit that this is probably one of the best MOOCs I've ever had. Course was easy for me to follow, but it was really exciting and interesting though. The MOOC is well organized, material is easy to understand and the course team is helpful.

I would recommend this course to everyone who want to learn Python and spend a great time writing interesting and fascinating games!"
378,"I really have nothing bad to say about this class as it was one great experience going through the course each week. The structure of this course is great, you will watch videos explaining certain problems, you will practice what you learned, do quizzes and mini projects. You will receive grades from your class mates. Whenever you have problem you can go and visit the forum or ask the lecturers, you will always get the help you need. I went from no knowledge at beginning to quiet skilled python programmer in 9 weeks and I really enjoyed learning this. I really appreciate this course and big thanks to the team from Rice university!"
379,"The layout of this class is great. Teaching in a virtual environment (recorded lectures) seems challenging, but the teaching staff that created and delivered this class did a great job making this class enjoyable. They provide you with all the tools you need to succeed with each week's assignment. If you watch the lectures and do the projects, you will be proficient at Python by the end of the course.

Expect to spend about 16 hours per week on the course between lectures, quizzes, a mini-project, and grading other students' projects (you have to grade 5 students' projects each week and the criteria is spelled out very clearly)."
380,"I am totally new to Python world, I really enjoyed this class as the videos were very informative as though it was a live class. The instructors added jokes or some fun parts in between so as to make it more interesting and fun to learn. Myself or my kids cant believe that I have created these games. My daughter loves the games I have created and she waits for me to finish my homework every week. Thanks to the instructors for such a great job! And the forums are very helpful too, to ask questions and find related questions that have been answered. The instructors responded back to my queries in a timely manner. Thanks a lot!!"
381,"What made this class was the whole package — the lectures, the quizzes, the development tools, and the forums. The instructors made the course fun and challenging, but kept the pressure on. The tools were fantastic — there were no major technical problems that I was aware of. I don't know how much of the infrastructure was provided by Coursera and how much by Rice, but it was seamless. The forums worked incredibly well. They helped people think through problems and gave them a nudge to get them over tough areas. They also provided a methodology for addressing development projects, which was done subtly but continuously."
382,"I hadn't programmed for about 30 years (anybody remember Fortran, PL/1, Pascal...) and wanted to get my knowledge updated -- Objects, Classes, Methods and all that jazz.

I chanced upon the Coursera ""Into to Interactive Programming with Python"" and must say that I both thoroughly enjoyed the experience and learnt a lot along the way. Getting there with Classes and Objects; Blackjack was a great leveller! Joe and Scott are both great teachers and I liked the way they played off each other.

Highly recommended and if there's a follow-up course, I'll be signing up.

Scott, Joe, John and Stephen -- thanks to you all!"
383,"I really liked this course, It is one of those types that will take you from no experience in programming to a place where you have confidence and several manageable projects under your belt. I have a significant amount of programming experience (>9 years) and while most of the core concepts were review for me, especially in the OO area, it was a great way to review fundamentals and learn Python at the same time. Also, having the mini projects be games was very motivating and good for someone who wants to be introduced to event driven programming in a very incremental way. I think odds are you will find this course enjoyable,"
384,"The content is extremely stimulating. The videos are broken into manageable segments (never more than 15 straight minutes) and the quizzes actually require some testing to get them right. But the great thing about this course is the project section. All the games you create are fun, fruitful and help you learn something new every time. You get a unique feeling of accomplishment when you finish each assignment. All the instructors of the course are really dedicated to the course and try to present the things you need in the simplest possible way. The course is hosted in Coursera, with whom I have had great experience so far."
385,"My good friend recommended this course for me and I was hooked instantly. There is some bias against these online courses and they do seem to multiply to the detriment of quality, but this class has shown me that it can be done to absolute excellence.
The lessons are very well thought-out, the instructors really know what they are doing here, and the supplied infrastracture and frame that is CodeSkulptor makes this class rather unique in my opinion.
I thoroughly enjoyed myself and it's been a while since I last felt motivation on this level to study anything. Python is great, this course is great, you are all great! Thank you!"
386,"Oufff there's no enough words to describe this Class. It was such a wonderful experience! The Content is fantastic, CodeSkulptor is fantastic. Omg... The Instructors are more than fantastic. They really enjoyed teaching the class and they really seem to like each other which makes the class more beautiful.
And finally I have to thank Coursera platform so much. It's literally the best online platform to learn on.
All in all, I'm glad to be taking this course, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Python, specially for who want to build games.
And of course I recommend Coursera as well to anyone who want to learn online."
387,"IMHO this courses is really one the best of Coursera. 1) Instructors; you really enojy and be profitable of the teacher's style. 2) the tools: CodeSkulptor. Fullstop. If you start, like me , to programming twenty years ago, you'll be grateful to what technology (and people inspiration) makes possible today. 3) The weekly mini-projects. No , serious where you can learn moving from Pong to Asteroids! Great Ideas, great teaching skills, and great fun. Anyone have taken this course never look at videogame at the same way. And starts to love Python elegance too. Thank you. I really enjoyed it, and I strongly recommend it."
388,I have taken quite a few courses in Coursera and I have to admit that this one tops them all. I will be feeling lonely now that this course has come to an end and Joe and Scott will be missed for sure. However this course has also given me the added confidence which was missing in me. I was able to complete all the quizes and mini project successfully even though I thought I won't initially. The course design was excellent and it covered all the basics that one needs to know to be up and running with python programming in a fun and easy way. I look forward to more courses from RICE and Joe and Scott in particular.
389,"This was an excellent course and a lot of fun. The instructors were very knowledgeable and did input some jocularity into the course. Thank you for offering this course online and free and I look forward to others. This type of course works well for me, as I am a physician and don't have a lot of time to attend brick and mortar classes. There were also times when I could not maintain the pace due to my main responsibilities. It was nice that I was not expecting a grade and that I could continue to do the lessons on my schedule. Again, thanks and I will keep looking for more courses by these two instructors in particular."
390,"A fantastic introduction to an interactive, object-oriented, programming language. Instructors used plain language and simple examples to demonstrate the basic concepts and their use. Using simple concepts, they methodically guided the students to build more complex ones and create a interactive game (RiceRocks) within a few weeks. This course is a must for everyone being involved in programming. The novices will have the course they wished for and the more experienced programmers might find a new perspective on things they already know and might also find a good reference for Python.

Guys, keep up with the good work."
391,"I coded Pascal and Perl back in the 1980s and 1990s and just stuck with Perl since then. I really needed to learn something more present day.

This course helped me along quickly.

The CodeSculptor programming milieu makes it easy to do the assignments and build fun games.

I thought the course quite ambitious when I saw at first that I was expected to code an Asteroids clone after eight weeks, but it turned out to be quite possible. And what's more: While getting there I learned about event handlers and object oriented programming - stuff that I never really go around to back when.

this course comes highly recommended."
392,"I completed both part 1 and 2 of the class from Rice and highly recommend it. This was my first experience with Python and object oriented programming. The class is well structured and provides nice templates, tools, and graphics to help you start writing interesting programs as quickly as possible. Projects are graded by peers and this system seems to work well. I think the class is well suited for anyone with some programming knowledge or fast learners with no experience. It was however, to much for my 12 year old son to keep up with, so you may want to start with something more basic for younger students."
393,"Great course. New concepts are introduced in a undestandable manner. The miniprojects and quizzes are fun and interesting. They can all be solved by paying attention to the class videos and materials, however, they still leave some room for students to figure out stuff on their own. The teachers are great and have a very friendly, fun approach. You can see they put a lot of thought into how to explain complex topics like object oriented programming so that students do not only learn the syntax, but really understand the idea behind those concepts. Some basic highschool math is needed but the teachers explain all of it."
394,"Awesome class! Not only does the instructors teach you about how to write codes, they also teach you about how to organize codes and develop good habits. I honestly learned a lot more from this course than I thought I would, and I realized that I can do way more than simple programs less than 10 lines long. Scott and Joe try to make the class fun and interesting for everyone, and the projects are very well-designed. Thank you!

Even though there are projects spread across the class, they actually go through each major component and teach you how to do it. So whenever you feel frustrated, just look at the videos again!"
395,"Just completed this course - it was awesome! I learned lots, even though I came into the class as an experienced C+ & coldfusion programmer. My son, who lives several states away, took it at the same time - it was his first programming course. He loved it as well. While we took different things out of the course, we both profited greatly. Making games is a great way to learn, plus the combination of the instructors kept things interesting. Good support as well for the few (ehem) times we needed it. This was a real class, not a youtube clip. You'll work hard. But you'll learn a lot and find it rewarding."
396,"In general, this class was a decent one for me. It had its pros and cons.

The advantages are that I learned how to build fun games, I learned a few things about bringing my code to life and interacting with it. I also learned some beginner's stuff about Python, which I kind of like as a programming language.

It had some disadvantages too. I am a student in computer science, so I have some experience in programming, and I did not find this class very challenging.

Although if you are a beginner in programming, I definitely suggest taking this course, and do not give up, it is much easier than you might think!"
397,"Brilliant. Really appreciative to Joe Warren, Scott Rixner and the whole team.

Course is structured around mini projects whereby you build a new game in python each week such as Pong, Blackjack etc.

Lectures are light-hearted and easy to grasp. Discussion forums are very active if you require help along the way. I took 2 other python online courses at the same time and this was easily my favourite and the one I looked forward to each week.

It's a bit surreal I was able to program an Asteroids clone game by the end of the course as my programming knowledge to start was zero.

Many thanks guys!!"
398,"I have just completed this class and found the experience to be exceptionally fine.

I would recommend this class to anyone wishing to learn python from an interactive point of view, as well as anyone who would like to experience the world of game creation from the ground up. Given the skills and tools provided by this course, I hope to try creating more elaborate, professional games in the near future.

In any event, I intend to continue the education process by taking follow up courses in python, as well as, hopefully, any other courses that Joe, Scott, John and Stephen might produce in the future. :-)"
399,"I had no experience with Python, but after 8 weeks I feel I am pretty solid on the basics. The course begins at moderate difficulty, but progresses to difficult. I put a lot of work into it, but nowhere near what the instructors put into it. They monitored how people were doing on projects and provided help and hints to keep me going. The quizzes seemed to be a layer of learning for me, because I could retake them up to 5 times to continue to improve. I learned a lot from doing quizzes. The projects each week are great for utilizing what is learned in lectures with the result of a working game when completed."
400,"This is a great class. I wish that the one i took in college would have been so much fun. In regular introductory programming courses they start teaching about the components of a Von Neuman computer, numbering systems (binary, octal, hexadecimal) and the grammar of the programming language you will be using. If you are lucky, you will write your first program after five or six weeks. Not so in this class. Professors Rixner and Warren have you writing programs from day one, and Prof. Greiner provides useful weekly tips. Also they are very enthusiastic and fun to listen to in the lectures.

Highly recommended."
401,"As someone who has never programmed in her life before, this was a great class that has taught me so much about programming. I am amazed at how much I've learned from day 1 to the last class. I am pleased to say I was able to produce the final projects which includes learning how to code old-school games such as Pong, Blackjack, and Asteroids. The professors were extremely helpful and actively helping the thousands of students. It's amazing how much one-on-one they were willing to give. The class is very detailed. It does take a lot of work, but the more you put into it; the more you will get out of it."
402,"""An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"" offered by Rice University via Coursera is one of the best programming courses I have come across as a student. The content is fantastic, the teacher are awesome. Both Joe Warren, and Scott Rixner offer invaluable insight into event-driven programming using Python. Hats off to them. John's programming tips are one of its kind, it will raise your level of programming for sure. The class is fun, the games that we've built in the course are enjoyable. I would recommend any one interested in programming to take this class, you won't regret the experience."
403,"I really enjoyed this class. I looked forward every week to the next video. I couldn't skip ahead like in other classes but it was fine. I did have prior Python experience from other MOOCs and that helped. The instructors were good at visually explaining each concept. I recommend dissecting each example they give you. The quizzes were tougher than I expected and if I didn't have the prior Python knowledge I could see the Mini-Projects taking longer than you'd expect. Even with what I knew I had to refer to the videos several times. In the end, I feel way more comfortable with Python. I'm sad this course is over."
404,"It helped me a lot to understand Python syntax especially classes and functions. I had some prior knowledge of syntax but I didn't quite understand the idea behind more advanced issues. Due to pratical exercises and making projects like games I was able to understand how programs work and how to use tools as functions, variables, loops, conditionals and classes. I would recommend this course to everyone who seeks to better understand core concepts of programming.
I also want to add that this class was very non-english speaker friendly as there were subtitles available to each video which came in handy."
405,"Course materials were well prepared catering students from zero programming knowledge to the versed ones. Mini-projects guides the students one step at a time but still leaving students opportunities to think and apply what they have learned.

Rice University is doing an excellent job offering this course. I think, as semesters pass by, with Prof. Scott and Joe, this course will become better and better and millions of students around the world would greatly benefit from this. Congratulations to the men and women behind this great MOOC, An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python. AAA+"
406,"Two months ago I knew nothing about Python or about programming. Today I'm planning games and modifications of games; what I didn't learn in the class, I was given the tools to go out and learn by myself. This class has been absolutely amazing; the professors are smart and engaging, the tools provided are excellent, and the class progression was fast enough to cover everything needed without being too fast to keep up. All through working on the last two projects, I found myself laughing out loud just at how much the class had taught me to do, and how much fun it had become. It's been fantastic."
407,"This is an excellent class. The video lectures are well structured and quite informative. The professors add some humor and playfulness into a very competent presentation of a power programming language. The mini-projects are fun applications that put the concepts from the lectures into practice. It was quite satisfying to complete the projects.

The peer evaluation and the forum discussions create a class community which provides even more help in the learning process . This is a seriously effective course by professors from one of the top universities in the US. A truly exceptional opportunity."
408,"I took this class as someone who knows how to program in other languages, but was interested in Python. After taking this class not only do I feel confident in python, but I also feel I strengthened in my core programming abilities and I feel like I have a better understanding of how other languages are structured. The professors are corny at times, but they are genuinely enthusiastic about the material they are teaching and are good at explaining the concepts in a simple, straight forward manner. Also, at the end of each week you have a fun game that you make to show off, so that is pretty neat!"
409,"This is the most complete CS course on Coursera I took so far. The course material was excellent and the material was presented in a very engaging way. Quizzes, mini-projects and the additional exercises were very good learning resources. I have also to praise the idea of including student's videos to the learning experience. Clear documentation of assignments and practical projects is a rare breed among MOOCs. A lot of time is lost in translation... This course however excelled in this area as well. The detailed documentation of the mini-projects was very helpful. A great MOOC course overall."
410,"Totally fullfilled the expectations I had when I signed up to do it. Its a basic programing course, very well structured; contents are given so that students can successfully accomplish each week's assignments, which are progressively more complex each week. Might be difficult to follow for people with no computer/calculus/engineering background but definitively is worth the attemp if you're interested in starting to code in this programing language. Will take 6-10 hours per week depending on student skills because there is plenty of stuff to do during course: videos, quizzes & mini-projects."
411,"I think the most valuable and inspirational part of the course is the description of development process of each mini project. When I putting agile software development method to practice, Sometime it is not so obvious about how to plan tasks for a user story. Not only I want to get the user story done with the tasks I list out, but I also expect that when I run the sequence of tasks, I can easily test each of them, and the tests contribute to the final result. The way that the professors describe (and instruct us through) the development process of mini projects is a very good example for me."
412,"This is an excellent course to learn Python. In 8 weeks alot of Python is introduced. The format of the course is very good and beacuse it concentrates on creating games it is fun to learn. The videos are all well presented and cover the various areas very well. The videos
are not too long so the information in them is relatively easy to absorb and understand. As someone who has programmed previously in various languages (but not Python) I think this course might be quite challenging for someone who has never programmed before. Would highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn Python."
413,"Highly recommend this class to people who are new to Python programming. The professors are having fun teaching it and in turn they make it fun to learn. The projects are to build games. And who doesn't like playing games? Once you complete your projects, you would have tangible games to share with friends and family. So you can enjoy playing together and you feel really accomplished. I had no programming experience, but I do have a solid math foundation, which makes understanding certain concepts easier. Though sometimes the projects are challenging but they are definitely manageable."
414,"I have to say... I didn't pass this class. I actually got a bit lost when it came to the topic of classes, and I didn't have time to recover before the last week or two ended. That said, the teaching was still excellent -- (somewhat uncharacteristically of me) I looked forward to pushing myself for something worthwhile each week. And while I learned that there is more in fact to learn... I suspect that I may be able to tackle those things eventually due to the supportive and positive approach of the teachers for this class and the resources that they've made available. Many thanks, guys!"
415,"Great course!

I really enjoyed how the instructors organize this course and the projects they chose for us to program.

The instructors provide a lot of help and step by step guidelines to help you organize your programming process. The discussion forums are a must and will help you get through difficult you might have with material or the projects and the instructors are quick to respond to your questions.

The instructors built this course in such a way that they want you to succeed and experience the joy of programming. If there were a 2nd course offered, I'd definitely take it."
416,"This class is World Class! It proves beyond doubt that an online class properly architected and taught with world class professors is a superior learning experience as compared to traditional brick and mortar classrooms. Rixner, Warren, Greiner, and Wong made you feel as though you were right in their offices and they were giving you personal instruction.

I can not thank them enough and I consider them the new Rock Stars of online learning. The success of this course reflects positively on them and Rice University and I am personally looking forward to their next course. Thank you guys!"
417,"I remember the first day the instructors gave a preview of the final programming assignment - a full-featured game of asteroids. I really wondered if I would ever get there ... but I DID! Even though I had never programmed games before (but always wanted to), their excellent method of instruction and comprehensive approach provides you with the essential CONCEPTS that help you through the process. You will learn these CONCEPTS (classes, object oriented programming, event-driven programming) by practicing them, and they will become part of you forever.

I highly recommend this course."
418,"I took this class to relearn programming and experience is fantastic.

It is amazing that Prof. Joe Warner and Prof. Scott Rixner take you to the level - where you start writing code and that too with good understanding of basic concepts.

Prof. John Greiner really pointed out some trivial mistakes one makes during programming. From my previous experience in programming, I can say that these are important things to learn. He teaches that in very simple and informal way.

Amazing way of teaching and kudos to all of you and Coursera to make this happen

419,"First of all, I'd like to point out that I am neither good at maths nor do I have any experience in programming. This class has such good organisation and content that I have grown to hightly appreciate maths, learn a great deal about programming and python and I love it all. The teachers are amazing, I'm absolutely sure everyone taking this class loves them. I would recommend this class to absolutely everyone who ever wanted to learn anything about programming or has already learnt some and wants to expand their knowledge or get different perspectives on writing a working python code."
420,"The ideas are taught in such a way as to make them stick. The means of combination and selection are taught early on, and basic ideas about data types made it easy to learn and apply new data types based on previous teaching. Assignments are challenging, significant and manageable, as well as being excellent finger exercises to build a reflexive ability to code all the facets of a solution without having to repeatedly refer to the documenation (which is excellent). The resources are superb and can help with coding challenges by giving small examples that relate to the problem to be solved."
421,"I took this course because it seemed like the best intro to Python for my goals that Coursera had to offer. While the content lived up to its expectations, the video lectures by the professors made the course stand out. Their sense of humor and watching them compete against each other, playing the games that we were assigned to program, added a human touch to the learning experience. It made you feel attached to the course the same way that you feel attached to watching characters of your favorite TV show. I highly recommended this course for people who want to learn Python from scratch."
422,"OMG lecturers in this course are amazingly cute!!!!! This course goes on a path of teaching-practicing combination, where you take brief introduction videos and immediately use the skill mentioned in videos to build a new cute project, and the projects are all simple but funny games that you would be proud of and play by yourself joyfully. For me, a zero-experience starter, this course is at medium difficulty level. Don't worry about if the course could be too difficult for you, since there are much available help both in the template and from TAs. Anyway, hope you enjoy in this course!"
423,"It was a great course. I learned a lot, there is no too easy, but the most important thing is that you have a lot of tools to keep going with the course, this tools include, pratice ejercices and well done videos (they are not only good in information and easy to understand, they are funny too), a step by step guidance, a special ""tips"" FAQ, and the forum, the last but one of the most important, there are a lot of people, at any time of the day, answering, if you want, you can't fail a project with these guys, that is one of the most important elements of the course."
424,"This was a great course. I took it as an experiment was MOOC's as well as to improve my coding skills. As an introduction to online learning, it was fantastic. The lectures, quizzes and projects were all well designed and generally challenging and fun in some way. The web-based code editor and runtime environment made participating in the course both at home and at the office simple.

The lecturers do a good job of keeping the material engaging and interesting. I'd recommend this course to anyone looking for a good introduction to programming in general, or python specifically."
425,"I have been a SW engineer for several years but Python was new to me. I took this course and stayed with it for all the 8 weeks. I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the online format. At first, I was a bit skeptical and unsure of the content. After 8 weeks, I will say it was fun. I did the quizzes and the mini projects diligently. I truly got a lot from the two professors. They made it fun with their little pranks. I thank them for making this free learning enjoyable and above all useful.

I wish them the very best and look forward to the next advanced version of the class."
426,"Scott and Joe have done a fabulous job with the class. Scott created an online python interface called CodeSkulptor, which was very easy to use and follow, the simplegui library for graphics was amazing. In all my life I haven't seen a library that easy to use. The lectures were very thoughtfully done. I was amazed by how Joe and Scott actually went into teaching geometry to help build games. I have never seen folks so dedicated to teaching. They tried a lot to make the class fun, each mini project was building a game. If time allows, I would take any other class they offer."
427,"This is an excellent course that was well organized and delivered. The progression from week to week over the course of 8 weeks was meaningful and the course format for each week was paced about right. The mini-projects which wrapped up each week's topics were challenging and occasionally the deadlines seemed a bit aggressive. However, there is plenty of support available through online discussion forums.

The professors were awesome. They were able to successfully deliver difficult concepts in video lectures and were able to hold my interest.

I highly recommend this course."
428,"I strongly recommend this course. I had tried to start learning programming a couple of times and with this course I finally learned the basics of OO Programming and got hooked up. For anyone in that situation, someone who wants to learn programming from zero and doesn't know how, this is a very good beginning.

You'll have to work, with weekly tasks, but there is plenty of help and you will always find an answer when you are stuck.

Thanks to all the proffesors, who are really great.

If you are considering doing this course, don't think it twice, just do it. You won't regreat."
429,"This was a very efficient way to lose my Python cherry. Good lectures, the forum is helpful when you get stuck on a mini project, and it is at just about the right level of difficulty. Don't let the fact that this is GUI-centric (if that's not what you're after) put you off, as it did for a coworker who started the class at about the same time I did. Because now I halfway know what the hell I'm doing as I move into more specific applications, while he is still lost in the desert. It is still an excellent introduction, even if making games is something you care little about."
430,"It was an all around great class. The instructors presented the material well, and although for someone like me with little to no programming experience, it leaned towards the more difficult side, I was able to complete and pass the course. This was mainly due to all the teaching aides, code examples and assistance provided by my peers and course instructors. I was surprised that the actual Rice University instructors are available as they are to a 'free' program presented on the internet. If you have looking for a great python course. You won't be disappointed by taking this class."
431,"Excellent instruction; very memorable and often funny. The curriculum is interesting and accessible, and there are many resources for help.

The difficulty of this course will be different for everybody, so I can only speak for myself. I had previous experience programming in BASIC, and HTML and CSS. I found this course challenging and I learned a lot, but I would not describe my experience as having been difficult.

I highly recommend this course if you have little-to-no experience programming and want to learn the basics of programming logic and Graphic User Interface."
432,"This wasn't an easy course, but it was so very rewarding! I loved it. And I really got a feeling of satisfaction for the programming projects we did along the way. I would look at each one when it was assigned and say, ""I don't think I can do this!"" And then I would follow the lectures and the programming guides for each project and it would just begin to unfold. I made it through the entire course and am very proud of the work I've been able to accomplish! Kudos to the instructors and those who assisted in the forums - there was always enough help to move forward!"
433,"Videos were informative and fun, tools supplied were excellent, I learned a lot.

I had no experience with games programming and only a little with Python so there were some new things to learn. But even without the background knowledge, the class wasn't difficult. There was a lot of support materials to work with each week and that was very helpful.

Really glad I took that class, lot of fun, I highly recommend it to anyone who has any interest in programming games, Python, HTML5 (the Canvas stuff applies to web programming in HTML5/Javascript), or event-driven programming."
434,"In one word ... addictive.

I am not a novice coder but new to Python and needed something to help me with the inertia of learning a new syntax. The course uses an online python tool (CodeSkulptor) built on Python 2.6 but much of that is still valid for Python 2.7 and 3.x.

8 weeks of fun with some lecture videos, some quizzes that really test your learning objectives and a mini project where you put the skills learnt to good (and did I say fun?) use.

I would recommend this course highly to anyone interested in programming regardless of the level of prior experience.

435,"This was my second attempt at a programming class - I dropped out of the first one for a variety of reasons.
Joe Warren and Scott RIxner were great teachers. They made the information understandable and the class lectures fun. Even those times when I felt overwhelmed with the content - the class lectures were enjoyable and kept me motivated. I found the material challenging - but not impossible. I had a great time watching the lectures, learning the code and programming the games. I was left with a feeling of accomplishment.
I'd recommend this class to any beginner programmer."
436,Great class. I had some programming experience before starting this course in the form of a Mathematics degree and a CS minor. I have also programmed in Matlab professionally. Even with this back ground I found the class informative and engaging. That said any beginners who are considering this course should be reassured that previous programming and math knowledge is not necessary. The class starts off with very approachable concepts that build a good foundation for the rest of the class. Any one who puts the time in and is willing to work hard will excel in this class.
437,"All very much! I love you! It was great to learn from these great teachers, just a dream. My mistake is that I signed up for training, with a low level of English proficiency. Zero programming knowledge, by contrast, does not prevent - the explanation is very affordable and simple. Russian subtitles were not in every video - and therefore had to translate English subtitles through Google Translate and revise :) twice. But increased their English) At the end of the course was very complicated, time to complete assignments missed. But I'm glad I tried. Thank you for the opportunity!"
438,"This is an excellent, one of a kind course that teaches programming, Python, and excellence in teaching. These guys are passionate about programming and share that on a personal level. They've clearly put 100s of hours into the course preparation - and probably 10x that into developing Codeskulptor. Codeskulptor is a full restricted browser IDE that lets you focus on learning rather than being diverted with trying to keep your environment stable.

Words are inadequate. This class, these guys. Bright, bright shining gems setting the bar for a MOOC stunningly high."
439,"This is a great class for all the reasons that are mentioned in the reviews. You learn a lot, and you get to have fun by producing an actual game. The Professors are hand-on. There are TAs who answer questions quickly. I am completely blown away by the fact that if I had a question, it was answered in minutes, not hours. Professor Warren answered one question I posted on a forum within minutes. I have never seen this in a MOOC. There is one thing I have to warn potential students: all MOOC classes take about twice as much time as they say they do. This is no exception."
440,"I have been skeptical about taking this class since I'm a beginner programming with little exposure of programming before and this course is all about game programming which at first I'm hesitate to take. However, after working on weekly project, which help me build skill to finish on the last project which is Asteroid game. I'm grateful to make that decision to join and also grateful by the instructors dedication to help me. Also, the fellow student are very friendly and eager to help in the discussion forum. I would recommend anyone to take this class and have fun!"
441,"This is an Excellent programming course. The instructors created CodeSkulptor that everybody can write python code in the same environment. The CodeSkulptor is very friendly to use, easy to cross-evaluate other's code, and most importantly it is easy to share the joy of learning programming with your friend when you finish projects in this course. With the guidance of the instructors, you will learn how to make games, which is so satisfying and fun when you realize you can make a computer game! I would recommend this course to people who want to learn programming!"
442,"It was a great experience to take this online course, because

(a) there was a time scheduling - you have to finish your homework at a given date

(b) there was a great community of other students, communicating in the forums, helping each other

(c) University of Rice has a great concept to teach a new programming language - by games which make fun o play, after it made fun to create them

(d) the enthousiasm of the University lecturer team was visible in the videos of the lecuturers themselves.

(e) After all, it is a great start to become familiar with Python"
443,"Fantastic course that's well put together and makes it fun to learn! The projects that you do not only teaches you go to program in Python but also gives you something visual and interactive that you can share and gives you a sense of accomplishment. You can see the practical application and it's not just theories or vague snippets of code that you must write, which is how I was taught mostly during school and university. This is a great and refreshing change, I haven't been this excited about programming in a long time!

I highly recommend this course!! Two thumbs up!!"
444,"Great if you already know a little python or another language. The course will teach you how to use a GUI library to make games.

If you want to learn programming by making games with this be prepared to put in a lot of hours, I would advise to do another introductory class in python before / along side this one.

If you can find the time to put some thought and extra features in, you can get better results.

445,"The professors/TAs and even the more advanced students in the community really do care a lot about this class and the material. There is a lot of help, 1o1 attention, group ideas, etc aside from the lectures. You will gain something from it if you're brand new to programming or an ace in another programming language. The mini-projects really make you think and the final results are astounding. You will have trouble with some things but fight through it and I promise it'll be worth it in the end.

I would love to see a followup class using the Raspberry Pi and Python :D"
446,"I had not programmed for about 10 years and decided to try this class to dip my toe back in and learn a language I had never used. I cannot believe how much I enjoyed this class - I looked forward to the weekly videos and assignments and now feel sad that the class is over. I enjoyed this more than any programming class I've ever taken. The instructors worked hard to make the videos informative yet entertaining, and the programming assignments were a lot of fun. I would be sad that the class is ending, but they have said they will eventually be providing more classes."
447,"This was a great class! I took it concurrently with Learn to Program: The Fundamentals from the University of Toronto, also from Coursera, and found this class to be more in-depth and specific.

More material is covered in this course, but you also accomplish a lot more. The workload can seem like a lot, and some projects will require a couple of solid hours' work, but once you finish, you'll appreciate how much you've mastered.

The lectures are very clear, sharp and to the point; they're also engaging and humorous as the instructors show off their playful side."
448,"This is the best programming class that I take. You can tell all the professors spend a lot of time to work on this. The class breaking down to details and the challenge level increases every week. There are times where I don't know how to write my weekly project, there are discussion forums that provided a lot help. Joe works really hard on this class. There are time when I submit my code through code clinic 9 o clock at night and he response to my email in a half hour. I highly recommend this class to everyone who is interesting learning programming. THANK YOU!!!!!"
449,"I do have programming experience but no exposure to Python before the class. The clas was very well organized and flow was working well to learn concepts by videos, test your knowledge by quiz and then apply the newly learnt concepts with Mini Projects. The guidance provided was mini projects was awesome and code clinic was a blessing when you got stuck with your code and need another person to find the bug. My only challenge was I do not like games and it made me think how to code for gaming especially what values are right for smooth movement of objects within the game."
450,"A great course. It is very inspiring to see that I was able to create such a game!!! (I mean the final one) after only two months of learning, and without having much prior experience with python!
At certain point, I wanted to drop the course. It seemed to me that it was going to take too much effort for struggling with too particular tasks (namely, that it taught the basics of simpleGUI rather than basics of Python). Glad that I haven't! I was wrong! The course does teach the very Python! I would never believe that one day I would implement a CLASS... But I did! :)"
451,"Before taking this course i knew very few things about programming, and virtually nothing about interactive programming. And today, about six weeks after starting this course, I have ended up making a very nice 2D video game- Asteroids. Well, for those with experience in programming this may be a simple thing, but for me it is great an achievement and this course made it possible in just six weeks.
I have taken many other MOOCs on different platforms, but style of teaching in this course was quite unique. You will love it and won't stop before finishing, seriously."
452,"The course is many great things but above all it is enjoyable. The teachers are not just well versed in their subject, but good at communicating, as well as good people. The content is well thought out, it is logical and easy to follow. The visual feedback of making games helps to offset the learning curve with the joy of seeing something that you have made. The forums are well cared for so you will get a good response to any questions you ask. I have learnt so much more doing this course than I expected. I would like to say a big thank you to all the people involved. :)"
453,"This was a great class for beginners, beginners to programing and beginners to MOOCs in general. The design of the course was intuitive, and I didn't find myself wandering around the course site, looking for what to do next.

Aside from that, the course taught much more than I expected to learn. The best part was where we learned the basics of OOP (Object Oriented Programing).

I highly recommend this course to anyone even mildly interested in programing. I think Warren and Rixner and the rest of the team do a great job of teaching python programing!"
454,"I'm new to python and OOP and I have to admit that I took much longer than the 8 to 10 hrs a week that we were expected to take building the mini-projects for this course.

At times I was very close to not being able to finish the homework but I always made it through just by consulting the forums.

The course was just hard enough to keep me on my toes every week and easy enough to keep me hanging in there for more.

You guys really rock and I geeked out along with you and your nerdy jokes.

Count me in for any other MOOC you come up with in the future."
455,"This is a terrific course. I had been a programmer for several years and especially on OO and GUI development. Still, I learned a lot from this course and was able to extent my knowledge to game development. One thing that stands out about this course its organization. This should be a model class for all MOOCs to learn how a class should be organized for online learning. All the instructors knew their topics very well and created a fun like environment that allowed smooth learning curve. I hope that they will start a new course on developing advanced games."
456,"I've taken several MOOC's and this was the best I've had. The teaching team clearly worked very hard to make this a good experience. The material is well thought out. The lectures are fun to watch. The problem sets were never tedious - always instructive. The programming project built skills and produced real products.

This class is suitable for ages 9 - 90+ and all backgrounds. I must say that I'm really sad for the course to be over, I not sure how I'll make it without my regular fix of Joe, Scott and John. Please - I need you all to make another class."
457,"This was my 1st online class and I thoroughly enjoyed it. With a different interactive game project to complete each week, I learned Python quickly and had a lot of fun along the way. The class was well structured and the professors did a great job. The web-based environment that they set up for developing our programs eliminated the technology issues that could have really complicated the class. I'm looking forward to applying what I've learned.

I'm hoping that Rice Univ. and Joe Warren, Scott Rixner and the rest of the staff offer an advanced Python class!"
458,"This class was an enjoyable challenge. I took up trying to learn programming a few months ago, but couldn't quite find a way to implement what I was reading. This course changed all of that. Some weeks the projects took me over 10 hours to complete, but I refused to quit.

The professors had a great personality and did a great job teaching the fundamentals of programming. I was honestly sad when the class ended because this course was so addictive and it gave me a way to focus my attention on concepts. If you're new to programming, this is an amazing course."
459,Great class as others have suggested. It was a fun filled 8 weeks for our entire family coding and playing games. Kids got excited watching parents code games for them. The pace is gradual and eventually starts to build up later in the course. The professors kept the momentum. This was serious fun. I would highly recommend this course anyone trying to dabble in python or even learn basic programming. Some math is required towards the end. However they professors provided all the supporting materials for math. So don't get overwhelmed by that. Great course.
460,"A introductory class, if you have been programming for a while you will find that this class is catered for the absolute beginner. Its focus is more on interactive or game programming than Python itself. I thought there would be more language fundamentals in this class.

There was some learning about native data structures, a little list comprehension, and the very basics of the OO parts of Python.

It is very easy to get started as all you need is a modern up to date browser. All coding and running of the applications done in the browser which worked very well."
461,"Incredible course - clearly a LOT of prep went into each and every lecture and the tools they built from the ground up to enable a common experience goes above and beyond.

Can't say enough good about the course and the instructors - higher quality instruction than I've received in a number of very expensive ""traditional"" college courses at undergrad and even grad levels.

I got the intro to python I wanted, and a much deeper grasp of object oriented programming that I did not expect from an intro level course.

Thanks again!

Chris - Mobile, AL"
462,"It was REALLY pleasure to spend time with so great people as Joe and Scott are. They did enormous piece of work. They did more than just teaching geeks how to write code. They shared the joy and showed how easy is to build games to ordinary people from streets. Make a game within 15 hours? Whoa! That's something! These guys did something great for the other people and for the world. With great amount of love. And they also inspired me to do such job too. Thanks a lot. It was really pleasure to meet you, guys.

Standa Novák, Czech Republic, Brno."
463,"I had absolutely no experience with programming prior to taking this course; now I can create video games. How cool is that?!

This is a wonderful class with wonderful teachers. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting an introduction to computer programming. One thing to note: maybe it was just because I had no prior experience with programming, but I needed a lot more than the 7-9 hours a week that was listed as the approximate workload. However, I really enjoyed every minute of it. It felt more like play than school.

Thanks, guys, for a great class!"
464,"So much fun! In the beginning of the course they show you what the final project will look like and at first you're totally blown away by it. How can I learn to do that in 8 weeks? But Joe and Scott, along with help from John and Stephen, have a very methodical (but hilarious) way of teaching the material. It just makes sense. The mini-projects are so gratifying when you finish them and they work. PLUS part of the class is just playing games. I looked forward to coming home after work to watch the videos and create my games every week. Thank you so much guys!"
465,"I started this class with limited knowledge of Python and no experience in programming computer games. I am amazed that I was able to complete this class and had a almost perfectly running graphics game as a final project. After I submitted my project, I was motivated to find out there was actually o bug in my code and the strange behavior of one game paddle is not related to my hardware or choice of browser.
The instructors were able to transfer a wealth of information in a short class and made me want to continue learning more because it is actually fun!"
466,"It is a very well organized course. Scott and Joe are great instructors; they teach you valuable concepts and make you laugh in every other lectures.
It took me about 10-12 hours/week for the course as am new to python. The mini-projects may seem daunting at first; however the course material, video lectures and practice examples are comprehensive enough to not to make you feel novice. The discussion forums were very helpful too. All my doubts were already discussed and solved in it, so I never had to post anything. Great course and great experience altogether."
467,"This course is excellent. The instructors are great. The lectures are interesting and well paced. I had zero knowledge of programming when I started and found some of the assignments very challenging, but the course provided all the necessary tools to figure out how to complete the assignments. Between reviewing the lectures, watching TA provided videos, completing practice problems and looking on the discussion boards I was able to complete each assignment on time. It was challenging, but in a good way. I would highly recommend this course to anyone!"
468,"This is a wonderful course for anyone interested in learning to code in Python.
So often introductory courses do not discuss graphical interfaces, so it was refreshing that by the end of the course I could impress my friends with great looking games!

The lecture style is very motivating, and it is clear that the professors are wonderful teachers. The course difficulty is fine-tuned so as to get everyone to a 'dangerous' level of programming! I do not have any criticisms of the course, and would like to thank the professors for their hard work and dedication."
469,"This was a really great class. Although I'm not specifically interested in creating games, this focus made the course extremely fun and rewarding to complete, while at the same time teaching you the fundamentals of python programming and how to think about coding problems in the right way, if that makes sense!
Although I've tried to get into python previously, life kept getting in the way - I found the weekly deadlines a great way to get some will power to carry on even when I was really busy.
I'd recommend this to anyone interested in learning python."
470,"I would take this course again. I really have no other programming classes to compare this one to. This class uses a video format, which I am not sure is the best way to present coding, but I was able to learn the fundamentals presented. The practice lesson are good, the quizzes are challenging. The mini-projects give the framework and plenty of step by step instruction so that you cannot get too lost or make too many compounding mistakes. The instructors and TAs respond to the forums well. The video quality could be better as the text can be a bit fuzzy."
471,"I loved this class. Scott and Joe are fantastic and entertaining teachers. The mini-projects increased steadily in complexity from week to week, and were absolutely addictive to try and get right. I was definitely doing a happy dance each Saturday before submission. My other classmates were also always supportive when giving feedback on the class assessments. If you had shown me the game we created by the end of the course in week 1, I wouldn't have believed it was possible. It's been great. I highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn Python."
472,"Great class. No prior experience. Really enjoyed it. Both the Coursera platform and the Rice University faculty made this wonderful experience possible. I sort of just started out wanting to learn something about programming. Although I might not pursue a game developer career in the future, I think this class has provided me with the right starting attitude and tools to embark on future programming tasks, whether data oriented or user interface related. Because of this class, I am now looking around for more classes and exposure to programming and data science."
473,"unlike lots of my professors, joe and scott are real teachers , they are great in research, have lots of patents while they can teach the beginners so clear so fascinating and so fast..
what makes this teaching group unique and awesome is that they love doing it,as well as TAs, they devote time and energy for nothing but willing to improve everyone's learning .
the same thing i can say to another professor of Rice ---Alma Moon Novotny, look at my immunology teachers.. i really really really suffering and so hard to hold myself from sleep at their courses"
474,"I love this class! Joe and Scott are great teachers. Not only because they explained new concept clearly, but also because the they designed this course in an amazing way. I would say this course a project-oriented program class. Which is great in three ways: 1. It challenged me for any material that I learned from lecture 2. It boost my confidence because I can code in new ways that I cannot before. 3. It was fun! Thank you guys for this great MOOC course. I wish anyone who tries this course would hang in there. You will find yourself enjoying it eventually."
475,"I'm a high school teacher with about fifteen years experience in technology and computer science and I found the materials, organization and support structure for this course to be among the best I've ever seen. I took the course hoping to find exercises, etc. that I could use with my high school students. Then, when I saw how well the course was put together, I challenged my high school seniors to register for and take the course along with me and they all met with a great degree of success. We had so much fun and it was a great introduction for them."
476,"My initial experience with basic programming was with C, which I must admit was useful in laying the foundation but Python is much more user friendly for beginners.

Highly recommended and especially with Codeskulptor, this course truly comes into its own by focusing on the aspects and fundamentals of event driven programming and making the immersion easier but challenging enough for first timers. A must do course to learn the disciple and approach to learning programming. Codeskulptor will make you dangerous and create a world full of programmers!!!"
477,"Excellent class. The teaching style works great for beginning programmers in my opinion. I personally learn from doing and this class provides you the tools to be able to do just that. Their is guidance and assistance when you need it. However, answers are not just given to you. You need to work and think about the concepts you were taught and find a solution that works. And in addition, the material was presented in a manner so as you had fun while learning the concepts. I wish there were more classes like this. Thank you Scott, Joe, John and Stephen."
478,"This class was awesome for me! Scott and Joe are the best teachers ever and the class was very funny. I enjoyed every video while learning tips to program interactive apps in python. I had already programmed in other languages and that helped me to accomplish the mini-projects, but I saw lot of people who had never programmed in their life and they learnt a lot and finally made all the mini projects. So, if you have the time, take this class and enjoy learning how to program in python and also enjoy seeing Joe wearing Ties when he loose a game :)!"
479,"Joe & Scott made the videos entertaining and easy to grasp new concepts. For me having a project sketched out the way it was helped tremendously. This approach will help me on some home automation projects using Python on the Raspberry Pi I have started.

The projects took the most time. Sometimes I would get stuck and finally jump over to the forums and low and behold someone else would have already asked a question about what I had a problem with. The high quality of the responses from the other students as well as the staff was tremendous!"
480,I had gone through 2 Python books and thought I had a bit of a grasp of programming but also knew I had zero confidence of completing even a small project on my own. I tried a couple different online courses and didn't find they helped much more. The Python course from Rice University on Coursera is awesome! I was pushed every week but the videos are awesome! The lecturers give a 100%. The other students in the forum are awesome! By far the best way I've found to learn programming. As an educator myself it is truly inspirational. Do the course!!
481,"This was a great experience. The teachers, material, community TAs and my peers were just so helpful. I did have some apprehensions going into this class since I'm not a gamer and my only interest was to learn Python.

But this class goes into OOP other parts of programming with such ease that you hardly get daunted by the more difficult nuances of programming. And while I still suck at playing online games, I do enjoy the thought process and appreciate the hard work and engineering gone into making a game.

I highly recommend this class!"
482,This was a terrific class. The professors are absolutely top notch. The class structure was perfect. The way the material was presented and the progression of the projects made things very easy to learn. I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning python but also to those who are interested in learning about event driven programming and object oriented programming. All of these subject were presented in a fun and easy to learn way. Can't say enough good things about the class and the fine faculty that teaches it.
483,I haven't seen a better mooc than this. And at the end of it I was absolutely addicted to it. It has great content and the thing that makes this class stand apart is the style of teaching. It is fun to watch videos and they are not boring at all. I also loved the video tutorial competition that was there. It was a great way to get people more involved. The code clinic was another thing that showed how dedicated all professors were to help us in our journey. Thank you Joe and Scott for teaching so well. Look forward to new moocs from you.
484,"Great course, I'd love to take another from this team of professors but I can appreciate the amount of time it takes to do a course with such polish. The lectures were informative and humorous. The programming assignments were great and we ended up with fun games to play around with. Thanks again for your hard work both during and in preparation for the course. I am going to use what I learned in the course to help get a group of 7th-12th graders interested in game programming. I think CodeSkulpter will really be a great tool to use with them."
485,"Truly a must-take for anyone interested in learning how to program, whether it be for games or in general, the concepts taught are extremely useful and extensible. I had some previous programming experience and learned a lot about Python and about programming regardless, especially on the side of graphics programming and event driven design. The professors are sincere, amusing, imminently watchable and kept me interested through the entire 8 week course. Bravo. I would recommend to anyone with an interest in python or programming in general."
486,"This was an incredible class which boosted my confidence at various levels such as programming in python, understanding of object oriented programming and building fun games. I looked forward to each weekend to get new videos and work on the assignments. This is the first weekend after the class is over and there are no more videos and I kinda feel sad. It was like one of those things which you would never want to end but alas everything ends. Thank you professors, hats off to your hard work and I thank you from the bottom of my heart."
487,"An excellent class all around. The instructors have constructed a well-planned process of learning Python and building complexity. Lectures are entertaining and informative. Lots of extra materials outside of lectures to aid the student learn. The projects were actually fun to work on, and I think the quizzes provided useful information in addition to testing student knowledge. All the people involved in creating this class put a lot of work in designing and planning, and it shows. Thanks to you all! Can't wait for the follow-on class!"
488,"What I hate about this course is that I always wanted to spend all my free time refining my mini projects until they were due. :) And I retook quizzes until I got 100% though I knew that no certificate would be issued. I enjoyed this course so much. It is different from many other courses in that you would have something to show off to your friends. Or if you don't want to show them off, you still enjoy being able to make some games to play. I really loved the way the professors presented their lectures. They were amazingly excellent."
489,"I took this class alongside MIT's 6.00x, and I think they worked well together. I started out with only the most basic ideas of python--MIT gave more thorough foundations, I think, but this class was extremely valuable in teaching application in an engaging way with the game homework assignments. OOP was also introduced very well, with just enough hand-holding at the beginning to keep me afloat until I got my head around it. I can't believe how far I've come in the last two months... Kudos to Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen on a great class."
490,"Bravo to Scott, Joe, John and Stephen on making this course enjoyable and rewarding! Based on this experience, I'd recommend the training to my professional peers and personally look forward to the next installment from this talented team. I found the course at a medium difficulty, requiring 5-7 hours a week of committed, focused time, and would rate it a 5/5 or A+. The class met all its objectives, had excellent,quick turnaround in the discussion forums by the TA's and Professors, and gave me what I needed to start programming in Python."
491,"This is a brilliant class. The way it's organized motivates you to complete the mini-projects and thereby internalize the concepts. All the mini-projects are games that allow for you to actually utilize the concepts youre learning in the video lectures.

It allows you to kind of see your progress and share it with friends and family.

I adore the teachers, you begin to get to know them as the class moves forward and they manage to make me laugh here there with their antics (to hell with javascript lol) (: thanks for all the knowledge guys"
492,"This is an excellent on-line course. Actually, I have paid for courses that were only half this good (more fool me!).

Seriously, the whole package is very well put together, it is obvious that the RICE professors have out a lot of effort into this.

The projects are challenging but achievable as are the quizzes. The support on the forums is good, and because the course is so popular you never have to wait long for an answer.

My only criticism would be that it is not long enough, I didn't want the course to finish! More from RICE please!"
493,"I thought this course was outstanding. I have informal exposure to several programming languages, but no prior python experience. I wanted to learn something about GUI programming, which was completely new to me. I was amazed at the level of projects that can be completed in a 9 week beginning programming class (pong, blackjack, and asteriods, in particular). The instructors do a great job outlining steps to successfully complete the projects without giving away too much. Overall a great introduction to both python and GUI programming."
494,"At this point I've taken a number of Python courses, and I think this series from Rice and the Python introduction from MIT (on EdX) are substantially better than the others. Perhaps the MIT course has a broader foundation, but this Rice course created more interesting artifacts. The Python coverage was roughly similar. This Rice course actually reminds me of an intro CS course I helped teach many years ago, where the sense of accomplishment might be the most important outcome. Yes, the professors asked for the plug, but I'm glad to plug away."
495,"I've been a physics professor at an engineering university for ten years, and have taught a lot of courses with online elements. I feel comfortable saying that this course is very well-designed. Like all MOOCs it's better suited to students that are self-motivated, but it does a great job of hooking all the little pieces together in a satisfying way. I also rather like their use of CodeSkulptor - I can program from anywhere and easily share my code with non-programmer friends and family. Very nice work by the teaching team in charge."
496,"Don't ever take this one!!!
The reason- they used a Code Sculptor to write, and submit a programms.
this have two bad results:
1) Code Sculptor used 2 version of Python, not a 3d. 2d version is outdated
2) when you write a simple loop in Code Sculptor , that in each step ask you type a number and then print out this number- it will not work in Code Sculptor as you expected. Instead it will print out this numbers only when terminated a loop

Instead of this one I reccomend a similliar course from university of Toronto or from Welsley"
497,"The instructors were great, I really enjoyed the playful atmosphere. It made learning seem like fun and not work.

The class is not very theoretical, but very game focused. the learning feels incidental, rather than deliberate. Which is a good thing, as pointed out above, but I also enjoy understand why I'm doing what I'm doing, which isn't always clear.

Still, I would recommend this course to absolute programming beginners. It feels really good to see yourself go from zero to building programmes, and was a huge confidence boost for me."
498,"I'm an experienced programmer but a newbie to Python. The course work was not exceptionally challenging for me, but way more fun and not much more time consuming than doing an online tutorial. I was thrilled when I got a 'bad ass' comment from a fellow student on my final 'Asteroids' project. Coincidentally, my son is a freshman in college and was taking and struggling with an introductory programming class using Python. I think he would have been better off (and definitely would have enjoyed it more) had he taken this class instead."
499,"An excellent class. The instructors were clearly prominently available. So much available in the way of support, video lectures, discussion forums, practice exercises, quizzes, mini-projects, all combining to make a great learning experience. The class delivers. It won't try to make you a perfect Python programmer, but will get you to a good level quite quickly. Lots of people asking for a follow-on course at the end of class, clearly hooked on Python, the instructor-led class, or both. Well done to all involved at Rice. Five stars."
500,"It was a pleasure to take this class. Personally I really learned something that is significant to me career and get-bigger-knowledge of programming stuff.

In the course almost every video lecture is truly funny and the time to do weekly assignment it was right. The discussion forums were and are highly active. Sometimes things got difficult but I always had the proper guidance to finish it. I truly recommend this course to an entrance in Python programming, not just game programming it also teaches general programming ."
501,"Just completed the class first online class I ever took. The instructors are very dedicated and did a great job. CodeSkulptor is an amazingly solid tool for development and code and test. I used python and I was amazed how well CodeSkultor works in a browser environment.

I highly recommend this class to all level programers and people interested in Python, an intro to Object Oriented code, Interactive programming and elementary game programming.

I had a blast doing the mini-projects... THANKS Joe, Scott, John and Stephen"
502,"I also took David Evans' CS101 class on Udacity, which is a great class for learning the basics of Python and fundamentals of computer science, but when I finished I wasn't really sure what I could do with it. This class goes well beyond that by introducing event-driven programming and object-oriented programming for making some pretty advanced games for a beginner. Now I feel like I can go out and create my own games and user interfaces. As the professors say in the first class: You will be dangerous after completing this course."
503,"Best online course I've ever taken.

The instructors make the course interesting and fun while still teaching the complexities of programing. The weekly mini projects give a great sense of accomplishment as you have a working game at the end to show for your hard work. By the end of the course i feel i have a more then firm basis from which to start learning new python code by myself

Would, and have, recommend this course to any and all who have even a passing interest in programing, python or trying something new and fun"
504,"I don't usually leave reviews, but I really appreciate how much work must have gone into the course. Each of the videos and assignments is well thought out and the instructors make lots of effort to be entertaining as well as informative. The course is geared towards learning games programming and teaching Python at the same time, which is exactly what I wanted. If you want a hardcore Python course then this might not be for you. These guys have set a very high standard on Coursera, I hope they come up with further courses soon."
505,"Being a professional programmer who was unfamiliar with python, I found the class very interesting. Have games as projects kept me focused and driven towards watching the videos and completing the projects. My one suggestion would be to offer different levels of templates for each project so that people with more programming experience would have more to do and therefore a bigger challenge.

Nonetheless, this was a good class. Much better than udacity.com intro to computer science class which teaches python without teaching any OO."
506,"This course was great. I didn't know anything about python when I started it and now I feel comfortable programming in that language. The content provided has a high quality and the system of the course, where you asses the work of your peers while they assess yours takes a good part in the learning process.
In my personal experience, this course was easy since I knew how to program in other languages. However, I feel anyone can take this course. The instructors are nice people and lectures are entertaining while they teach you."
507,"This course was fantastic! I'm a beginner in programming and in Python and this course had the right amount of information and challenges.
It was not always easy and it required me some time to complete the projects but I feel that I learned a lot.
The instructors are very knowledgeable and the community TAs are always ready to help out. The programming tips provided are very useful not only for python but for any language.
I highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn python or know a little and wants to improve."
508,"Fantastic class!

Teaches you how to think and solve problems.
After going through many tutorials on the internet and following along with them step-by-step, THIS CLASS is the one that finally got me to be able to write something on my own.

This course's pacing is also fantastic. They don't go too fast, and they don't tend to go slow. You're definitely going to have to put a good amount of time into these classes every week, but you're going to come out the other end victorious and proud of your accomplishments again and again."
509,"This course is amazing!!

It trully is.... though some weeks it's a bit challenging.

It got really difficult for me to start thinking in terms of objects... to understand what is a Class and how methods are used, but, since all mini projects are really really fun and game oriented, I found a way to get stucked to it until it works.

And believe me, watching that ship in Rice Rocks flying the way it's supossed to be is priceless.

It's a new me after the course... as Scott Says, I kind of feel ""dangerous"" with Python now."
510,"Very enjoyable class, accessible for beginners, and valuable for those with prior programming skills as well. The instructors clearly enjoy teaching, and did a great job of organizing the lessons with reinforcing Q&A along the way. Project assignments were accompanied by templates where appropriate to get the students moving in the right direction. Pairing of the coursera platform and the CodeSkulptor programming environment worked well together.

A thoroughly enjoyable course - thanks to all who put this together!"

512,"Excellent course, nice way to learn Python, even an old hand like me (35 years of programming in more than 20 languages) had to think hard some of the time. I had fun all of the time. As a teacher I was pleasantly surprised to see how much thought the authors put into designing the course. Even when you are not interested in Python but want to know how to design this type of courses it would be wise to have a good look at this example. In short: you learn Python and have fun, and it is an excellent example of MOOC teaching"
513,"Great class, particularly the interactive tool Scott Rixner developed at CodeSkulptor.org . The professors defined fun and challenging projects that directly utilized class lecture topics.

Peer review offered an additional way to learn from other code solutions, so you have lectures videos, teacher code examples, your own work, other student code solutions, and the forums for many alternative approaches to the topic.

Appropriate for beginner programmers or experienced programmers who just want to get a feel for Python."
514,"Great course. Great proffessors. Great lessons.

If you want imperfect lectures, you are not on the right place :-).

I don't have anything bad to say about the course. Only good words.

I took it on coursera, just to ""try out"" coursera courses. It turned up to be way better than what I expected. As a web programmer, I beleive that this course has something to offer to both the beginners (someone who's never been programming) and proffessionals.

Great work proffessors. Just keep up the good work ;-)."
515,"Great class. Creating a game every week felt a lot more like a hobby than an assignment. I personally had about 1.5 years of solid programming (but no python) under my belt before taking this course, though many had never coded before and still found this to be useful. That being said, there were only about 2 weeks where I actually felt too qualified. They progress through complex topics very efficiently and introduce a GUI quite quickly which is refreshing when I think back on previous endeavors in learning programming."
516,"This course was exceedingly helpful. I have attempted to learn programming before by way of a couple of different methods and this was the easiest and most successful at getting me in the door and over the initial hurdles that come with learning new skill in a skillset that I am not particularly good in naturally (math and mathematical reasoning).

I feel like I now have a strong footing to go further with programming, thanks to this course, its instructors, and the legions of helpful students populating the forums."
517,"This was an amazing class. I would like to thank Professors Rixner, Warren, Greiner, and Wong for teaching this class.

I am 11 years old with English as my second language, so it was a challenge and a stretch for me, But I got through the whole course with above 90% as an average for the projects and quizzes, thanks to the help that I got from the other students, especially another 11 year-old, known as Richard X.

If you take this class, you can expect to get challenged, stretched and supported. I really recommend it!"
518,"It is not the first Python course I've taken, so I can tell by comparison that IIPP is definitely worth time and effort to participate in. Totally recommended! You will learn not just basics of programming in Python but each time you create game or something, so you have real application of what you learn, not just theory. That is the most valuable part, i guess. Also, this course makes you better thinker, it gives you all the opportunities to think differently, deeply and getting the best way of solving problems."
519,"It was Amazing. It is a good feel when professors are sharing you their joy teaching this class and having fun,and at the same time bringing you a good material to go straightforward learning the language. I found it very helpful to start python programming with the programming templates and the describtion of the projects. Another thing to mention is the Codesulptor which they are using as a programming environment which is very simple and helpful and at the same time staying near the real programming world. A lot of thanx"
520,"I loved the class and the support. As someone who has never coded before it was encouraging and at times frustrating. However, those moments when something worked as intended were just that Eureka moment, that feeling like you've struck gold. I learned a lot and hope to use what I've learned in the future. I really enjoyed it and would strongly encourage anyone who has an interest in learning how to code to take it. It's definitely worth the effort and hope that Joe and Scott are able to put together more courses like this!"
521,"This was an excellent course but is also a steep learning curve. Whilst it aims at beginners it really needs some previous programming experience, but there are plenty of resources available and the forums are helpful.

It takes around 8/10 hours per week but really depends on previous knowledge.

The OOP section was a roadblock to many but the code clinic assistance was helpful and prompt to reply.

I would highly recommend this course to anyone learning Python or even someone thinking of programming."
522,This course is THE best way to get introduced to programming. I've taken two other intro CS courses at other Universities and like most intro to programming courses they teach through very generic projects which feel more like tasks. This is the first intro course where you create a program that you can have fun testing it out after your done. This free course actually did a much better job of letting me understand OOP than paid college courses at state universities. Thank you to the Professors of this course.
523,"This was an engaging, fun way to be introduced to the basics of Python and the use of Python for event-driven programming. The use of games for the projects made them challenging, but at the end of all the work you got the reward of playing the game you just wrote. The instructors clearly love what they do and enjoy one another, which comes through in how they interact and in how they teach. I hope to get to take another course from them, moving on into more advanced Python. I highly recommend this class."
524,"A liked it and it was from the start to the end a very good educational experiance. I am for 40 years in IT and did programming in the traditional languages. My goal was to get know how of the new technics. (object oriented programming and the windws user interface etc ) The educational level is very good and even if you do not have any experiancy in programming it is a good way to start .

The structure of the cource is very simple and sollid foundation to go on.

I had a lot of fun and a plesure to do it"
525,"This class was really fun because it incorporated game development into a basic programming class. It covered a lot in such a short time besides programming basics, such as graphical user interface programming and object oriented programming. Though challenging, the programming projects were not impossible to do because a nice template was provided as a starting point, and step by step instructions to accomplish the tasks were provided. The end result of the projects were fun games that you could actually play!"
526,This is a great course for anyone who wants to learn python and games programming. It teaches you how to use event driven programming and object oriented programming to create games. This is all done within an on line tool provided by the course team which is very sophisticated and yet easy to use. The course team put a lot of effort into making you productive and have fun at the same time. I cannot recommend this course highly enough if you have any interest in how to create games then this is the course for you.
527,"This is a Great class for an introduction to Python. This is my first class taken in an online environment. I am very pleasantly surprise of how well the class is structured and organized. It is well worth my times. I learned a lot about Python. The CodeSkulptor is such a valuable tool. Without it, it will add much more difficulties in learning. My sincerely thank to all the teachers contribution and efforts. I hope there will be a follow up class for Python with advanced topic.

This is well appreciated."
528,"Si estas interesado en aprender a programar juegos, esta es la clase que debes tomar. No importa tu nivel de conocimiento o experiencia programando, esta clase esta muy bien disenada y los instructores, aunque son unos tremendos nerds, hacen un excelente trabajo en mantener el ritmo y el conocimiento fluyendo. No sabes ingles? no hay problema! hay subtitulos para todos los videos y foros en tu idioma con estudiantes que se ayudan mutuamente.

No lo pienses mas, es gratis, es buena, es lo que necesitas."
529,"This is a great class for python noobs. It's informative, it requires a reasonable amount of effort, the video lectures are interesting and fun, but most of all I LOVED the programming assignments. Really difficult thing to achieve from an online course, this is a learn-by-doing course, which is right up my alley! Plus the teachers are extremely nice, friendly and encouraging, I think it's the best attitude I encountered in an ""online teacher"". I had a great time doing it so I honestly recommend it!"
530,"I just finished this class and highly recommend it. This is the third time I started trying to learn python. This class gave me the structure to keep at it and succeed. The course is an excellent balance of short lectures, templates that take care of the frustrating or borring parts, and the work load was very reasonable. Also, you run your programs through the web browser and don't have to get python working on your computer and translate things to your type of computer. Everybody works on the same platform."
531,"This was a really great class. Despite the amount of work and strict deadlines (making a miniproject every week, doing quizzes every week), it doesn't feel like a burden at all. I looked forward to making the mini projects, making a little game every week and I felt proud after finishing them. The instructors are great: the lectures were concise yet interesting and often funny,

Bottom line: if you want to learn programming in Python, this is a great and fun way to start! You learn a lot while having fun."
532,I spent 2 months learning some basic python on my own before taking this course. This course is fantastic! The course materials are easy to understand. The quizzes are challenging and really ensure that you understand the material in order to move on. The mini-projects are pertinent end extremely rewarding to complete. The teaching staff is wonderful...they genuinely enjoy teaching programming to students. This is the perfect course for someone to get their start in programming. I really loved this course!
533,"If you're looking for a course in Python, then this is one of the best, if not THE best, courses to take.
The pace and content are suitable for complete novices and above. Its approach to learning Python is for you to enjoy and have fun as your skills increase. Each phase gradually exposes you to more and more of the power of programming in Python.
Joe and Scott's teaching style is friendly, and easy going, which eases you through some of the more complicated features of programming. HIGHLY recommended."
534,"I´ve enjoyed taking this course. It took me from informal pieces of knowledge from the Web, to an organized, structured material with quizzes and projects which helped me improve, acquire and apply what I learned into practical applications like challenging game development. Now I´m proud to show what I learned, my friends and family tried the game projects developed under the guidance of instructors and I´m getting ready to showcase all I learned to future employers. Thanks Rice, instructors and Coursera!"
535,"The class ends so fast !!

after all those weeks staying back at home, watch the video and doing the assignments each week

finally i manage to finish up the course

Really thank Joe and Scott for doing such a great work in the videos

It motivates me to do more advanced program each week

Everyone should have a try with their classes

Code Skulptor is a really great !

without it , it will create a big mess

Hope to see more competition on the game between Joe and Scott

Great Job on the class !!"
536,"I can't say enough good things about this class! It has been a great experience. The professors did so much more than just putting some notes and video lectures online -- you can tell they really made a commitment to the MOOC format, and obviously thought a lot about the broad range of their audience and how to make the class successful and valuable to students from many backgrounds. It was fun, exciting, challenging, and rewarding. I give this class, and its teachers, my highest recommendation."
537,"I just finished this class and very honestly, it exceeded all my expectations. The professors did an amazing job of presenting the lectures and designing the projects to maximize learning of the material.

The framework at Coursera adds to the effect and in the end, makes possible a better learning environment than the classroom itself. This class changed my mind about online education.

If you want to learn to program, take this class. You'll thank yourself for doing so.

538,"Fantastic course. Just finished this one and it was very good. An excellent intro to programming class. The concepts are well explained, and the environment is really good for learning to code.

If you're already a programmer, this is a very good intro to python. I picked it up quickly and accomplished a lot more than I expected. The development environment is a tad restrictive, in order to help the new folks out. But the instructors are absolutely top-notch. Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
539,"i enjoy the challenges this class offers. The amount of work and the level of difficulty is proper from week to week as the class progress. I have to say the OOP throws me off entirely and it took so much time to for me to finally understand enough with lots of reading in the forum to finish Black Jack mini project. I hope the course material will be available in the archive so I can always revisit for reference. The instructor is great and the people involved is great in the forum, particularly Jan."
540,"I took this class as I was interested in learning Python. The instructors were awesome! They kept the class really fun and we built games for the mini-projects that slowly increased in the difficulty. That kept me going back to take the class every time a new class video & mini project was posted. If not for the puns and healthy rivalry between the instructors, I would've enjoyed the class lesser. I would recommend this class to any person who is interested in learning programming! Hail Sir Loin!!!"
541,"It starts slowly, so even those who had never programmed before will be able to follow with no problems. The teachers are great and the video lectures are very informative and fun, not like an actual classroom in a university. The forums are busy and you can always find help over there should you get stuck. You will eventually create fun games using an online python platform called codeskulptor. Overall it was really nice, definitely recommended for whoever wants to learn python, even from scratch."
542,"I really liked this course. I haven't taken programming in a very long time (can you say FORTRAN?), but I found it easy enough to get started, and challenging by the end. I really like the instructors - just the right combination of fun and information. You learn programming by making games, which really kept my interest, The discussion forums were invaluable. But don't take this course unless you have time to put into it. I found it very rewarding and was actually a little sad when it was over."
543,"Nice and entertained course where you learn a lot of things related to GUI projects and python basics. From my point of view, it might be good to have a different sort of help levels when developing a weekly project. Some of them were really explaining exactly what to do, so I kind of miss some place for the imagination :)
I knew how to program in Java and did some first steps on python. However, I wanted to improve and learn it from a course to learn the corner cases and best practices about it"
544,"Great class for absolute beginners. The course is on Python 2.6 (I'm normally working on Python 3), but there are only a small number of functions taught in this class where that matters.
As someone who's had some exposure to Python, I didn't learn quite as much as I would have hoped. On the other hand, Introduction to Interactive Programming is only the first third of a specialization on Fundamentals of Computing, so I'll definitely go on with the rest.

The instructors are all great and good fun."
545,"I think that this is the best course to get started with Python or programming in general. If you have some experience with other programming languages then, you can finish this course faster as the instructors are really awesome, especially Scott.
Some courses just go through how to write Python programs and they basically focus on the syntax and tricks related to a specific programming language. This course follows more of a practical approach and focuses on the fundamental concepts of programming ."
546,It is a great course. I think it is intended for somebody that already lurked into the programming subject and has some theoretical overview. Although the hands on experience is invaluable and I recommend this course to everybody. It is great to be able to see that those popular games of past aren't that complicated after all and by the end of the course i am able to actually code them myself - AWESOME! Go and take the course. Professors are great and the subjects even better. It is truly fun learning.
547,"This was a fun class. I used to be a developer but stopped writing code about twelve years ago. This course was perfect to get me back into the rhythm and joys of programming. Programming games make the course that much more interesting and enjoyable. Also, the passion and enthusiasm that the instructors exhibited really made the course approachable and enjoyable. I hope they come up with more courses on programming as I would like to continue down this path and with these same instructors."
548,"Great class. Even as an experienced programer (in many different languages), I found this class a great interdiction as it focused on actually doing things -- and those things were games. Also, this class focused on good programing and debugging techniques which I've often seen newer programers struggle with. Plus the class material was presented in a fun manner and the interactions between the instructors was humorous. Overall a great experience and highly recommended by this vintage engineer."
549,"I just completed this class and it was an awesome experience. I had never done programming before and I feel like now I have at least a basic understanding of what it is and how it works. And although I don't think this is is a field that I will pursue in life, it definitely made me want to try a slightly more advanced programming class in the future. I will not deny that I spent many nights stressing over this class but in the end it was worth it.

Thank you Scott Rixner and Joe Warren!"
550,"A great introduction into graphical programming with Python that really doesn't come with any expectation on your ability to code. Modules are relatively short but treated in a way that allows you to quickly get started. Whilst it's hard to achieve perfection, there's no doubt that that was the target here in developing the course and framework. I've learned a lot from it and, although sometimes challenged, never felt overwhelmed like I have with other ""introductory"" courses."
551,"Great class

Just finished it! It was FUN all the way through, even at the 'hard' bits.

Very enthusiastic and knowledgeable teachers.

Came from zero programming experience, and made it all the way through

It opened up a new world for me, and 100% sure I will continue to explore this 'world' more ... cant wait for the advanced class from the same teachers.

anyone that wants to get started in programming - I can highly recommend this class ;-)

.... AND BECOME DANGEROUS, JUST LIKE ME!"
552,"This was my first online course and I thought that the teachers presented the coursework in a very smart way. The projects as games kept people excited and ready to learn new material from week to week. And the lectures were amusing with their quirky personalities.

I had a great time learning Python for the first time in this course and I would take another course with Joe, Scott, and company. I am also spreading the word to my friends to take this course the next time it is offered."
553,"I very much enjoyed this class. What I found truly helpful is the scaffolding provided. A mini project does not start with a blank page. It starts with a template which has helper classes and functions ready for you to use and to help you see success after only a few lines of code. I also liked the progression of the stages needed in building the game project. The competition between Scott and Joe was hilarious. I laughed so much. Joe, maybe you can make Scott wear a funny T-shirt next time!"
554,"I have an engineering degree and hadn't taken a programming class since college (more than 10 years ago). I have done a little programming in HTML and Javascript on my own, but wanted to work on my programming skills so I signed up for this class. I enjoyed the class and learned a lot. I will continue programming using the skills I learned and would take another class from this group of professors if one becomes available. My only suggestion would be to offer a certificate of some kind."
555,"Brilliant class! Serves as great introduction to coding, not just because there's such a wide array of topics covered, but because it's also fun! Through the course of writing interactive games, you cover event driven programming, GUIs, OO programming, and lots of standard python. It's clear that the instructors put a huge amount of time and effort into this class, and I really hope they continue to do so for people who take this class in the future, since they've done such a great job with it."
556,"This course utilizes game creation projects to teach interactive Python. Learning a new programming language is inherently difficult, but the game programming wrapper made the incremental learning very manageable. Completing each game project provide a great sense of accomplishment. The instructors are outstanding. This course is fun, challenging, engaging, and far exceeded my expectations. I would enjoy learning many other programming languages when presented in the manner of this course,"
557,"It was great experience to participate in this course and interesting part of this course is ""the way of teaching"".

It was always in encouraging manner, the methods followed to make us understood were really great.

I would like to suggest to any one who wants to start taking a online course ever just start with this python course.you will really enjoy it.especially I thank JOE and JOHN for their enthusiastic teaching which always keeps me on hold of this course till the ending."
558,"A fantastic course which teaches you python to a 'dangerous' level! Each week the mini projects relate to programming games and are therefore fun to do! The course teaches you the basics in the first few weeks and then progresses onto an Object Orientated approach - which may not be easy at first, but once you have got your head around it, it opens your mind to the true possibilities of programming - so it is worth a few all-nighters! Thanks Rice uni (Joe and Scott) for such a great course!"
559,"A very good course, especially for beginners in programming. Teachers tried to make this as fun and informative as possible, and they accomplished that goal. The lectures are interesting to watch, not boring at all, the mini-projects are challenging for beginners, more experienced programmers may find them a little bit too easy. But as the course says, it's only an introduction. Full 5 stars in each category, and looking forward to see more courses from these teachers and Rice University."
560,"Before the class, C programing is the only language I know. I would like to learn python as it is a popular high level computer language with a lot of support package. The course is very interesting. I think making games is a clever way to learn new language, which bring us a lot of passion to persist in this class. Everyone would love playing games. Thank you for all your effort in the class and behind the class to make it interesting and enjoyable. I think the class is a great success."
561,"Really nice and friendly introduction to Python. There are plenty of intro courses to get into programming, but one of the challenges is engaging the person taking the course and making them feel like the instructors care about what they're teaching. This course does a great job at this.

It also gives enough direction and support that most people who commit the time to it can complete it. The forum is also active throughout the class session, which can help troubleshoot more specific bugs."
562,"I really enjoyed this course. The instructors were fun and engaging, and the pacing was good for an introduction to both Python and programming in general. I finished the final project of Part 2 feeling like I'd understood and created something cool and interesting, with just enough guidance to keep me from getting lost. I took this as the first course in the Open Source Society University curriculum, and after finishing the course I'm looking forward to continuing to learn computer science."
563,"This is my first course with Coursera and it really taught me a lot, not just with Python and the wonderful CodeSkulptor, but of the many people that have sacrificed their time and effort, to teach others and guide others such as me who have had no previous programming experiences in the past, thanks Mr. Rixner, Warren, Griener and Wong! The community for learning is excellent and I look forward to taking many more courses including yours again, so once again, thanks teachers! :)"
564,"Fun, geeky, love it!

I quickly found myself skipping social events to finish coursera assignments, often hearing comments like:

- did you pay for it?

- so what happens when you do not hand in the projects?

I said, I don't know, does it matter? Teachers motivated me to be committed enough to care and to learn.

Code Sculptor is great and the course material just makes sense. I feel myself to be a more elegant coder after this course thanks to the instructors.

Highly recommended!"
565,"Loved this course. I would take any course taught by these professors. I work 40 hours a week, have a wife and 2 kids, and keep generally busy. This course didn't take too much time (5 to 10 hours a week) and the time was very enjoyable. I've loved playing video games since I was a kid. Now I have a much better idea about how to go from a concept to a fun little game. I really hope to have an opportunity to take another class with these guys. Heck, I might take this one again."
566,"I have tried to learn computer languages several times. With this class I was finally successful. Thank you Prof Warren & Prof Rixner. This class was totally enjoyable. The lectures were understandable. The tests were hard but with persistence, I was able to get through them. They were a great learning tool. The forums made me feel like I was in a class and not on my own. Anyone who might be interested in learning more about computers and how they work should take this class."
567,"A superb combination of video lectures, quizzes, mini-projects, online documentation to support what was taught each week. Course material flowed very well. Video lectures were the right length, informative and entertaining.

The Codeskulptor IDE was well implemented.

Having known nothing about Python, this course brought me up to speed quickly to feel confident in continuing on for further development with this programming language.

To Joe Warren and Scott Rixner, well done!"
568,"An awesome class for an intro level python course. I am a moderately experienced programmer who wanted to get into python and this course has helped me a lot. After taking this course, I realized python is such a easy albeit powerful language to learn. I would recommend this course to anyone who wishes to learn python and have some fun while learning it.. My friends would get really amazed when they saw my games which I build during this course. Thanks professor Joe and Scott!"
569,"I have been long time to programming languages just for hobby and sometimes to boost my productivity at work. I have seen tons of video lectures for various languages like Java, php , python etc. Non of them had this spirit that this class had. The course was fantastic and always motivated me to go more and more. I sugest to to everyone that wants to make a start or to go into a better understanding of Pyhton and object oriented programming. Thank you for this great experience!"
570,"I had a great time taking this class. I have a CS degree, but wanted to learn the Python language, and this class made it very fun. Each week we programmed a game as a mini-project, and the tool we used, codeskulptor, was built by the professors to work on modern web browsers, so I could work whenever I had time from any computer. I was really impressed with how well that tool worked, and with how entertaining the class videos were. Overall, a great experience with online learning."
571,I would recommend this class to everyone who has little or no programming experience at all. The video and the topics are well organized and you will find that your programming abilities are improving day by day. The only thing I didn't like is that most of your code is not immediatly usable in Python because they made use of an excellent GUI library (simplegui) which is not downloadable. Anyway I enjoyed a lot the course and my Python programming knowledge has increased a lot.
572,"I really enjoyed taking this course! It was really fun, interesting and sometimes challenging. Video lectures provide you with most of the information you need to do your assignments (mini-projects), if you struggle with something there is always help on the forums.

The idea of teaching Python by building games from a scratch is great, it is really captivating and makes you want to do more.

I would definitely recommend this course for others that are willing to learn Python!"
573,"I think the class is just great. I was able to find the answers to all of my questions just by watching videos and browsing through the discussion forums. The material is explained nicely. I also like the way the class is built and how the projects lead you from using simple things to more complicated ones like classes. This class is a good starting point not only to learn about the different structures used in python, but also about areas of their usage and how they work together."
574,"Excellent introduction to Python and event driven programming. Scott Rixner (CodeSkulptor) and Joe Warren take the lead and are fully engaged instructors. Terrific online learning experience overall - Definitely worth the investment in both time and money. If you are a new programmer, I believe you will find the pace of the class to be demanding. 6-8 hours a week will be required to successfully complete this class (some weeks significantly more for the more involved programs)."
575,"It is a very good and fun class with a nice teaching style. I think it is a very good idea to use games as projects. I had a prior knowledge of object oriented programming in Java and it was still fun and good knowledge that I got out of this class. It reminded me of some concepts that I kind of forgot already and showed me new stuff, too. Most importantly it shows everybody that programming is fun! Thank you for this class! And thank you coursera for the platform and certificates."
576,"Very good content, easy to follow, well explained. I don't even a word of Python before the start but completed the course without problems.

Instructors are very, very good. Keep us motivated, good help, funny jokes, I'm really sad now the course is over because I was enjoying a lot.

Coursera is a good course provider, but now has changed the policies and you can do the tests and mini-projects only in paid mode. Those are really bad news for all who have money enough to spend on it."
577,"I started the course with some programming experience and thought this was only a stepping stone for later courses in the specialization. Hell no, I really learnt a lot from this class, especially GUI programming! Scott and Joe are wonderful teachers, full of sense of humour, and I kind of got intrigued by their teaching style. The course assignments are well designed, with proper difficulty. The best part I never expected is, this course has a storyline between Joe and Scott. :)"
578,"I'm working in CS for a long time and I have programmed in several lenguages so I think I have an advantage when I get the course but as I have taught too many times I can appreciate the abstraction task the instructors have done to conver all the programming aspects.

I know that there are several resources I have not need but I have took a look as discussion forums where people can ask doubts, extra exercises for the week material, ...

In resume, I like it very much :)"
579,"AWESOME!

The professors are excellent and really made the material fun and easy to learn. They were actually very funny too in the videos, which made them very lively and fun to watch. I looked forward to every week.

What's even more amazing, is the coding platform developed (CodeSkulptor) just for this course!! It's a web-based IDE and that really democratizes the course! I thought I was going to have to install python, etc, etc, but all you need is a browser!!"
580,"This is an excellent class!

It is useful for both experienced and inexperienced programmers: those new to programming get to learn the basics that every programmer needs to know; and those who already are familiar with those things get to learn a new language, which is always a good thing.

Personally, I learned quite useful aspects of OOP and got experience creating programs that interact with user through a visual interface.

I had fun, this was very entertaining course!"
581,"This course was absolutely fantastic - I programmed a little in Basic 30 years ago (!), and doing this course brought me right up to date and has given me the confidence to talk to career programmers in their own language so to speak. Each week the lectures and quizes give you a lot to think about, and looking back I'm really pleased that whilst they never let you rest on your laurels, they never let you forget how much fun the knowledge that you are gaining truly is."
582,"This was an excellent course. Material was presented in a graduated manner, Major points were well explained, and there was enough on-line material to find information not detailed in the lectures. The arrangement of exercises, quizzes and assignments was spot-on, allowing to build the skills step-by step. The only problem I found was that (for me) the time requirements towards the end became more onerous than I expected, so be aware that you WILL need >10 hours/week."
583,"If you know the basics of Python and want to start programming games and GUI based applications this is the right course. The course quality is the best I have experienced, you have access to professors, videos, discussion forums, examples and a development environment. If you commit to the course you will find you can program python games and GUI applications, and become more comfortable reading code and using all the online resources available to you. Do this course!!!"
584,"Here comes a word from someone with zero previous programming experience: the class does the trick, provided you are really interested in topic. Sometimes you might find yourself stuck doing some particular part of a program but forums mostly carry the answers. I've completed every game in the course and really enjoyed both process and result. Highly recommend for anyone with same background as there are not so many clear resources on how to start programming by yourself."
585,"Really well taught course. You could tell the professors spent a lot of time designing the course and even more time making sure that it ran smoothly. The projects were perfect for at-home learning for someone with a full-time job, and made the course continuously fun and engaging.

I highly recommend this course for beginner programmers or those interested in getting some experience with GUI and event driven programming.

I hope they teach another class in the future!"
586,"Great, fun class. I learned a lot and had never written a line of Python in my life.

I had some programming classes in college, and I am an engineer, so I had a good grasp of the mathematics in the class, but none of that was necessary to do the work in the class.

The lack of a certificate or any kind of completion data gave me no incentive to do the weekly quizzes though. I stopped even trying to complete them in the allotted time about halfway through.

--Doug"
587,"An excellent class but could be improved.

This class does a great job of made-for-remote-learning lectures (as opposed to repurposed tapes of classroom lectures) with practical, hands on exercises. Having a concrete goal in the shape of a mini-project for each unit is a terrific way to learn programming.

The shortcomings revolve around the uselessness of peer review and the hassle of relying on a set schedule rather than learning at your own pace and convenience."
588,"As a seasoned non-GUI python programmer and gamer I took this class to ease my way into GUI programming. The class was fantastic, I really liked their style, pacing, etc. (even though a lot of concepts were familiar). I was always eager to see the next mini-project lecture and delve into implementing it.

They plan to offer it again. I would recommend taking it, if you want a quick start into python GUI programming.

The best-made free online class I've taken so far."
589,"I started this course with very little programming experience - a smattering of JavaScript and PHP - and feel I've definitely gained a couple levels at least.

It was challenging - each project had me stumped at times. Discussion forums were very helpful in breaking down blockers into manageable pieces.

The game-oriented format was rewarding. Each week resulted in a project that I could proudly point to, ""I did that.""

Next task - how to apply it."
590,This class was by far the best class I've taken on coursera so far. Joe and Scott were able to explain complicated programming topics in a way that made sense. They were awesome at providing hints on mini-projects. I loved being able to be able to review other people's work too as it taught me about programming as well since I looked at the code when testing the game if the student did something I hadn't thought of. I look forward to more classes from these instructors!
591,"This is an AMAZING class. I stepped in by chance and was just hooked by the great teaching skills of Mr RIXNER & Mr WARREN. The progression is quick, assignments are challenging, Forum and community discussion extremely helpful, and building game, fro scratch, is possibly the most rewarding experience I had during my professional life. Thank to all the people who made that possible. I can't wait to keep learning more and applying my skills t complex business problems."
592,"Absolutely fantastic! I highly recommend this course to people who are interested in learning the basics of programming in an entertaining way. The course teaches the basics of Python along with GUI programming, and at the end of each week you get the satisfaction of playing a game that you built. The instructors were engaging throughout the course and set up a very nice progression from beginning to end. I feel great about what I can do know and am excited to try more!"
593,"Lecturers are great and you really get things done.

Even if you feel overwhelmed at first, just start with the project notes - it has actually all the required steps in a logical order. In that sense it also teaches you to work in mini-iterations like real world programmers - code and test it, then write some more and test the change again, and again...

It's a good course for complete beginners or even seasoned IT people who are looking a way into the Python world."
594,"I don't feel there is much I can add to the already extremely positive feedback.

In short, this was a great class on python. I learned a lot about the language, but also had a tremedous amount of fun. There were times where my life schedule had me rushing to finish an assignment, but now that the final one is submitted, I find myself wishing that I had more to work on. Kudos to Scott and Joe. I hope to see more from Rice generally and these two great guys specifically."
595,"Great course for those wanting an interesting introduction to object-orientated programming. Fun too.

The course is well paced with weekly mini-projects and quizzes which encourage the student to practise the taught material.

As someone with a little programming experience (although not in Python), I was looking to learn what the advantages of using an object-orientated approach would give. The course provides superb examples of the power of this type of programming."
596,"I really enjoyed this class. btw: It is one of the few classes that I have actually finished even though I struggled a little bit at one stage.
The professors had an engaging style with a fun approach which made the classes enjoyable and the concepts understandable.
The projects seem daunting at first but if you follow the steps and review the lecture material then... before you know it, you have the project done and are impressing family members with what you have built."
597,"This was an excellent course and an excellent introduction to Python for beginners.

All instructors are fantastic, amazing, prepared and clear in explaining stuff. Material for the course is well organized: videos are great, mini-projects and exercises really helpful and useful.

A great experience, a well done course.

Congratulations: if you need to start with Python, either you have already got some programming experience or not, just start with this course."
598,An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python was my first Coursera class. I had a little bit of programming experience but nothing related to games. This class took the time to teach the basics in a very hands on way. The teachers then quickly moved on to more challenging subjects. It was amazing how quickly everything seemed to come together. I enjoyed this class immensely and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in learning how to program games.
599,"Mon premier MOOC : une expérience inoubliable, des professeurs sympathiques, drôles, clairs (qui parlent un très bon anglais), soucieux de faire réussir les étudiants, une organisation très fine, des mini-projets à rendre chaque semaine. J'ai eu beaucoup de plaisir à suivre ce cours et suis vraiment triste d'arriver à la fin de ces 8 semaines. Une merveille... Je le recommande sans aucune réserve."
600,"Hands down, the best course I have taken so far. Joe and Scott made it fun to learn and enjoy it at the same time. Learning the concepts and then right away applying them to build games [which I loved], and to see it materialize right before your eyes, was extremely satisfying. Course material was very well presented and there was a well thought out incremental progression, building up on the concepts taught earlier. I highly recommend this course to everyone."
601,"This was the best time investment considering my IT education. Programming lessons I found seemed too complicated to start and weren't very motivating because of it. I had never programmed before and I was amazed how well teachers get the meaning across to students - the material covered in this class seemed really simple. What is more, I feel like finally I learned something useful. Thanks a lot to Scott, Joe and the whole team!

No cons for me. It was SO COOL!"
602,I've taken several online courses and this was by far the most interesting and useful. The progression from simple to more complex is handled in manageable jumps and concepts are introduced in entertaining games. The instructors are personable and so clearly interested in what they are teaching that I always looked forward to another lesson. This class has shown me the potential for online courses and will remain the standard by which I will judge future classes.
603,"This class is absolutely amazing. Suitable to people of all levels, starting at complete beginners, it is a really nice introduction to interactive programming. It is very well structured with the professors investing great amount of time and energy to provide lots of help with all the assignments, making even the most challenging ones manageable. It is truly wonderful to see so much effort and support in a free course! Above all, it is a fun course to do."
604,"I came to the class with some programming knowledge from engineering classes more than 20 years ago. Things have changed quite a bit and the instructors, particularly Joe and Scott, were terrific. The videos were concise and informative and the assignments did enough to make you not only refer back to the lectures but also dig a little to learn on your own. It was a fun class and sort of addicting. I wish we go just press on, but I'm very happy with what I learned."
605,"The quality of the class has been excellent. The material and the manner in which the class has been taught shows the amount of effort the professors have invested in putting it together. Not only in putting the videos together, but in the structure of the material and it's presentation.

The approach for beginners and folk that have program previously is engaging to learning, and creating the curiosity needed to move forward in the field.

Excellent Job!"
606,"This class allowed me to build games I had played when I was a teenager and dreamed to write such once. Now it seems to be so easy. I appreciate highly the tremendous teachers' effort and the very productive way of teaching. So far I have attended many online classes, but this one is in the top three of the best courses ever! Special thanks go to fantastic four. Guys! That was great!

I recommend this class everybody and I look forward to the next edition!"
607,"Excellent course at an excellent price! I have had computer programming classes in the past in college, but this free course did the bet job in teaching me proper programming techniques and concepts. Due to the peer review system, I had more detailed feedback and grading than I ever had in undergrad (where they just run your code through a program and check the output line-by-line). Thank you for offering this course and re-sparking my programming creativity."
608,"Everybody know that the key for education is motivation. Motivation can´t only come from inner will of students. It must be reinforced from the teachers, the content, the stuff you build... this class gathers a bit of everything to conform a wonderful adventure through the pillars of gaming programming, from the most basic level to something if not amazingly complex, at least nice enough to brag about it to friends and family. It works, I´ve done it!"
609,"I took this class from beginning to end. There was enormous diversity in the student body in terms of language and culture, never mind math and programming knowledge. It taught students to be sensitive in respect of their fellows on the forums and grading. The format of video lectures, quizzes and projects was excellent. The relaxed and friendly nature of the lecturers was very conducive to learning. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn to code."
610,"Fantastic experience.

I've never had any experience in programming but the engaging projects had me bragging to friends that I ""taught my computer physics!"". I never thought I would have this much fun when I signed up but now I'm recruiting artistic friends to create characters for my own projects as well as leveraging what I learned to create tools for work that wow my boss.

Thank you to the team that spent so much time putting this together."
611,"The course was absolutely fantastic! The teachers Scott, Joe, and John (thanks guys) introduced Python in a way that was easy to understand, yet challenged me each week with a mini-project that allowed me to put to work the skills learned in class. The peer editing process was more enjoyable than I originally speculated, and the project reviews from my fellow classmates were helpful and uplifting.

I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Python."
612,"This class was just what I needed to wrap up with programming and get rid of all the ""bad"" teaching I had from previous programming lessons.

The teachers were super fun and incredibly talented on teaching complex subjects in an easy manner.

The skills I got thanks to this are beyond simplicity and I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to start from beginning as well as those with previous knowledge on programming (variables, loops, etc)."
613,"I came in having no experience in programming at all and 8 weeks later I yelled in jubilation as my Spaceship finally exploded with the correct explosion animation when hitting a tumbling asteroid. How awesome is that?

Especially, when my attention span for uninteresting subjects and/or dry presentations is pretty much non-existent. All you need is knowledge of the English language and structured thinking - no math, no programming knowledge and no tech jargon."
614,"I already had a programming background but this class definitely did a great job to set a strong foundation and lead people incrementally to build games.

I think the content of the videos was great, they really put a lot of effort into it, and also the weekly tests and mini-projects help become familiar with the concepts.

I would definitely recommend this class to any beginner or intermediate programmer.

You won't be disappointed.

Ignacio Rovirosa"
615,"This class is beyond outstanding, better than many of my former classes at Stanford. I look forward to future offerings such as Computer Graphics, C++ Game Programming, or Advanced Python Game Development. This course should give you the foundation not only in Python but also the fundamentals in object-oriented programming. Scott Rixner, Joe Warren, and John Greiner are excellent instructors, and you'll learn at great deal. I just wish this course would never end!"
616,"Great class.

If you want to start with python programming this is class for you. Even more if you want to start with programming in general. Take this class.

It is very well structured and prepared. But most of all it is not boring! The language is plain and accessible just with the right amount of tech jargon :)

Also the projects you will create during the class are games a real playable games :)

I really recommend this course.

PS: Codeskupltor rulez :)"
617,"This was an excellent course and an excellent introduction to Python for beginners.

All instructors are fantastic, amazing, prepared and clear in explaining stuff. Material for the course is well organized: videos are great, mini-projects and exercises really helpful and useful.

A great experience, a well done course.

Congratulations: if you need to start with Python, either you have already got some programming experience or not, just start with this course."
618,"highly accessible and enjoyable class.

the material has been prepared in a very well way to be accessible to non programmers with an increasing level as the course go.

The highlight of the class is the programming interface: Rice professors went through the effort of developing their own interface to make python accessible to anyone with a webbrowser!

you'll be surprised how, in a few weeks, you will be developing object oriented games of Pong and Asteroid!"
619,"This was a wonderful experience for me.

It helped me learn about event driven programming and also about game programming.

It was amazing that at the end of the course I was able to create an Asteroids clone.

The professors were great, the forums were very helpful.

One thing I enjoyed a lot was the fact that for each project I had to grade 5 of the other students' projects. It was a very interesting experience which had me looking at other people's code."
620,"Excellent teachers and very relevant material for learning the basics of Python. It does not require maths, or any prior experience in programming, thus it is very doable even for people who do not consider themselves good in any of these things. For people who do have experience in programming and have a good understanding of maths, the same instructors are doing more advanced courses.

All in all, great experience and no regrets about taking the course."
621,"This is a great course! It was a lot of fun, very well organized, and covered a lot of material. The instructors did an amazing job of structuring the lectures, quizzes, and projects so that each week built on the previous week's work. They designed the assignments for maximum effect--we didn't get bogged down in small details and were able to focus on the big picture of interactive game programming. I'm recommending this course and Part 2 to all my co-workers."
622,"I can't imagine a better starting point for new programmers. The course set-up and the brilliance of CodeSkulptor (including the documentation and the visualisation tools) removes many of the typical obstacles to programming (computer literacy, math knowledge). Of course, the astute student will have to dig deeper into those issues, but that is beyond the scope of the course. The instructors are especially great and have made a good transition to the MOOC world."
623,"As a biologist and not have much programming experience (other than doing statistical analysis on R), this class really widen my thinking and showed me that I can do programming as well ! Learning programming with building games is the best idea and teachers Scott and Joe are awesome! I hope to continue Python and building games. After this class, I started considering dive on programming and may be shape my career in that way! Thanks you for making it possible :)"
624,"Everything from the structure, to the quizzes to the practice exercises ensure you fully grasp a good chunk of Python.
I've had about 3/10 on-hand programming experience before taking this class, and I felt I was average. I took this class, found I was below average and saw myself rise through the ranks. Still not the best programmer, but I appreciate the fact I really enjoy doing it. This class has helped me move forward with assured confidence and fresh skills."
625,"This is an excellent class, as it builds in a very logical and empowering way upon simple techniques to the point at which a student is not only manipulating objects and functions quite capably, but is also able to focus on elegance and precision in their work. Truly a wonderful piece of didacticism - well done to the team at Rice Computer Science Department for putting it together, and a hearty thanks from me for the knowledge and skills you've imparted to me."
626,"I had some programming experience but not much. The material was accessible; the teaching was light and interesting; time was tight in certain weeks, but I felt compelled to push forward and get the work done. I definitely learned a lot and am looking forward to these guys putting out another more advanced course at some point in the future.

I usually like to give balanced reviews, but in this case, there was nothing I did not like about this course."
627,"I second all the positive comments. The lectures, codeskulptor programming environment, assignments, resources, grading process ... everything was outstanding. I'm especially happy that I now have a handle on object oriented programming. My last programming was 30+ years ago and since then I've made a few feeble attempts at OO without success. This class made sense of it and it was painless . I hope there will be more courses from these instructors."
628,"Everyone who wants to be a programmer, and even more so, everyone who is already a programmer, should take this course. Besides being fun (and very funny) Joe, Scott and John built a very practical and elegant mental framework for how to approach any programming project. Start small, build from there. Test your work often. Save your work often. Use the documentation. Not to mention the real-world constructs of meet-the-deadline and match-the-spec. Bravo!"
629,"If you have problems with object-oriented programming, seriously, try this course! I had some programming classes at my university but never fully understood this idea. THESE fantastic, smart and funny instructors explained it so easily, that right now I have no clue why my brain wasn't able to comprehend it earlier. Learning by creating games is a brilliant idea! Really, you should try this class no matter how big your experience in programming is :)."
630,"Excellent intro to Python and programming in general. For some of the later projects, some background in programming is helpful, but Joe, Scott & all provide ample information to get your programs running. Just be prepared to spend some extra time if you are new to programming.

Excellent fun projects each week. Great help available in the forums.

I would highly recommend this course to anyone the least bit interested in learning some Python!"
631,"The Class was Great! We've been adding up skills week by week and getting easily through complex concepts (compared to old style courses I've taken years ago). The course was challenging and fun. Another great thing is sharing discussions and thoughts. Online Learning is really the way to go , and it's great for human beings to have access to free education all over the world breaking the digital divide.

The Professors were really amazing. Thanks a lot!"
632,"This was a great class! The instructors put a lot of effort into making the lectures entertaining, and they definitely succeeded (they often had me laughing!). The course content was great, and I now have a much better understanding of object-oriented programming. I was a little intimidated when I saw all the mini-projects listed on the syllabus, but the instructors equip you with everything you need to know to complete them. They did an amazing job!"
633,"Provides a beginners guide to both python and gui programming with python. Lots of fun learning to program very nice games with a simple interface. Can even share the games with friends so they can play as well as see the code that is needed to create the game. A feature that I didn't think I would like was evaluating other students projects. However, it was very instructive and helped in learning different styles of programming. Highly recommended."
634,"Incredible online class.

Profs who truly care about their material and about teaching and carry on at a rate that students at any level can follow. Unlike other classes, they don't ramble on and require extensive use of the pause button throughout lectures to take notes; the length of the lectures is the length of the lectures.

Learned an incredible amount about programming in Python and looking forward to moving into using it for the real world."
635,"This is a great introductory class in Python programming. I really liked the practical aspect of the course where you had to develop a game as a mini-project. This was fun and you learn a lot. I thought the peer assessment was a fantastic idea. You could see how other people solved the problem and what code they wrote. That not only helps you learn, but you also get some new ideas. Overall, this course has been a pleasure to take! Highly recommend!"
636,"I appreciate the enthusiasm of the instructors. The pace of the class is way too intense, however, for the aspirations of the class in the amount of time given. I understand fully the sense of accomplishment that can come from a ""challenging"" class. However, it's important to balance this students don't feel frustrated and give up. This class may aspire to make programming accessible and fun to everyone, but at the moment, it's preaching to the choir."
637,"The course content is well organized, starts from basic information about programming, ending with classes and their applications on games, The instructors are very good, friendly, humorous, and decent. They even developed a special platform for online programming, saving, and even visualizing code execution (code sculptor and viiz mode). Coursera is a decent course provider, but the team of Rice university are the best I saw in many related courses."
638,"Great course.
Very powerful course that takes you from an absolute beginner to an upper-intermediate level. This course teaches you all you need in procedural programming, event-driven and object oriented programming in a matter of weeks.
What makes this course so unique is the CodeSkulptor tool that eases the difficulties of installing any software to get things ready to program.
I love the support you get from the lecturers and from classmates."
639,"This is the best class, regardless of online or in person, I have ever taken. Joe and Scott are amazing teachers that made all the concepts so easy to understand. And I can see they are people full of life and this is why they can make the class so much fun! This class is so well-organized and impressively entertaining. I have no programming experience at all before this class. I learned so much from here and now I am on my way to become a data scientist!"
640,"I really enjoyed taking this course. All the instructors were enthusiastic, knowledgeable, well-spoken and delivered the course excellently. You really can feel their passion for the course in their teaching. They go the extra mile! The difficulty was just right for me and the assignments are fun and engaging.

I really look forward to more courses from the instructors and Rice Uni.

Thank you to Joe, Scott, John and Stephen for a great past 8 weeks!"
641,"Took this course alongside MIT's Introduction to Computer Science with Python as I couldn't choose between them. I'm glad I continued with both, as the quirky banter, entertaining game-design projects and GUI instruction provided a great complement to the more theoretical MIT course (also highly recommended). Solid video lectures, quizzes and mini-projects and a depth of supporting practice exercises and explanation of concepts when you need them."
642,"This course was terrific -- I knew nothing about programming before I started and I feel excited now to continue my learning journey and build some cool applications and games. To Scott, Joe, John and Stephen -- thank you all so much for the time and effort you graciously put into the course -- it was well-organized and the lectures were well taught and digestible. I greatly appreciated it and look forward taking another one of your courses soon!"
643,"Great class, learned a lot. Nice videos to watch, makes it easier to learn and the code template/stubs were great to get started on each project.

Wish it didnt require so many (five) evaluations of other students. Maybe 1 or 2 evals would have been enough.

It does take a lot of time per week (about 8 hrs for me, watching the videos and actually writing the programs, asking for help in the forums, etc).

But overall, great class."
644,"Excellent class. The structure and progression of the class were well thought out. This was my first free online class and my experience from this class got me hooked. I have just started another class and have signed up for a third starting in the Spring time frame. One last note, the instructors were excellent and provided a fun atmosphere to learn in. Thanks for your passion for teaching and all your efforts in constructing this class."
645,"This class is excellent.

Through learning to program games you are taught a wide variety of programming techniques, thinking analytically and problem solving.

The effort that has gone into this course by the teachers is out of this world, their passion, knowledge and teaching styles inspire and make you want to learn more and work hard on the class.

Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in learning to program.

Top course."
646,Being a someone who has programmed for 10+ years in both web and application development I must say this course is a great introduction to Python and Interactive Programming. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn either a new language or who is just getting started with programing. The professors are extremely knowledgable and fun to learn from. I'm looking forward to them offering a more advanced class on the subject in the future!
647,"This is a great course to take. The classes are really easy to follow, not because they are not challenging (because they are if you are a beginner programmer like me), but because the teachers are really good doing their job, and make the lessons and programming fun. I really enjoyed this class, and I think after this I'll keep on programming small games on my own because it's really addictive. Thanks to Joe and Scott and all the course staff!"
648,The class was done very well and I learned a lot. The Teachers were excellent and made a real attempt to keep things interesting. At times I thought the learning curve was just a little too steep because they were trying to cover so much in the 8 weeks. Probably would have been better as a 10 week class so they could have spent more time covering some of the material in a more gentle matter. This is the best on-line course I have taken.
649,"This is just amazing and awesome opportunity to get familiar with Python and beginnings of the OOP. Teachers are awesome guys as well! I recommend this class to everyone who havn't had Python experience yet. And to those who would like to become familiar with OOP concepts and basics. Full of fun good mood and optimistic, open minded people class. This is great.

Thank you guys! I have already assigned to 2 or 3 more classes on coursera.org :)"
650,"This was the first online class I have taken and I can honestly say it was an amazing experience.

The staff is extremely professional, clearly investing a lot of time and effort into the lectures, projects and communication with the students.

I would recommend this class for anyone who wants to take first steps into programming or to experienced programmers who want to learn python in a more organized way other than true self study."
651,"The classes always were fun, with a great team presenting the course. The only (small) criticism would be that sometimes the amount of time spent on being funny reduced the amount of content that was delivered.

All up: a great class to learn programming at beginner level, a little too slow and shallow if you already have experience in some other language.

Codesculptor is a great tool to teach programming. Thanks for inventing it!"
652,"This has been a great course! Really enjoyable while doing it. You will definitely learn how to program in Python, and definitely have a lot of fun. Of course, nothing comes without paying some effort, and you must work through the projects to take full advantage of the course! Thanks to the instructors... Without them, the way how they put the course, and how they transmit their joy in the class, really helps the audience to keep them engage!"
653,"Awesome class! This team was able to make a great course, with concepts explained in a fluent manner. Codeskulptor is a fantastic tool, keeping class focused in coding, students should know how difficult is to have an homogeneous environment in programming class. Tips and assessment guidelines was also useful to make a steady guidance in building programs and allowing class to accomplish projects and being motivated to go to the next level."
654,"I like this course because it is not hard to start and follow through.

Materials were presented in well-organized manner and the lecturers have a sense of humor to make the video lectures more interesting to watch.

The CodeSkulptor environment made it extremely simple to start coding and debugging right away.

Projects were not hard to complete given the willingness to put in time and effort.

It was a pleasure to take this course."
655,"It is a really amazing class. I have to say I enjoy this class so much and the day I expected the most every week is Sunday. On these days, I can have new video classes, learn new skills, build my own game programs and correct other guys'. I want to say thank you for Joe and Scott, you are the best computer language teacher I met during my University time and to be honest, I have recommend this class to many of my friends. Thank you very much!"
656,"Working full time this course allowed me to test myself and my ability to learn new skills.

I really enjoyed this class, the teacher where great!, I wish i had this kind of teaching when i was growing up. The methods and use of technology was great, coming from South Africa this is what this country really needs to improve education.

If you want to learn basic event driven programming using Games as a medium I highly recommend this course."
657,"Fantastic class, I would recommend it to anyone starting in programming or looking to pick up Python. Profs, assignments, teaching and support are all amazing, the work that they have put into this far exceeds what I would ever expect from a free online course (or even a paid university course, for that matter). I'm very grateful to everyone who has worked to make this class possible, and look forward to the next course in their specialization!"
658,The amount of work that goes behind the scenes must be immense. The mini-projects are fantastic as they lead / guide to develop not only your work but also on how to think about the problem domain and how they connect with the videos. The quizzes also ensure you're kept on your toes. I'm glad I could complete the course this time as work commitments previously prevented me time wise. I feel I have good tools now to progress further with Python.
659,"The course was a lot of fun. It was rewarding to write code that worked, even though it often took a lot of time, because I had very little experience. The lectures, quizzes and discussion forums were very useful. The instructors give a lot of guidance for the mini-projects, with a template and step-by-step instructions, which made it possible for me to successfully complete the projects. It was hard work, but worth it. I learned a lot!"
660,"I really liked this course. I do not work as a professional programmer, but I did programming during colleague. I've been willing to resume and expand my programming experiences for some time now. I've been also willing to learn the basis of how simple video games are programmed. Satisfactory, I've found that this course has fulfilled my expectations for both goals. I really encourage to take this course as it worth your time and effort."
661,"Its amazing. Using GUI to explain fundamentals of programing is the best way. The same time it is interactive and memorable, and practical.
Then it is very fun and engaging, especially the teachers/professors. Their relation, their passion for the class, just hooks you and makes you want to finish the assignments without any hesitation. At the end of the day you LEARN A LOT BY HAVINNG GREAT AMOUT OF FUN, not everyone can give you this."
662,"A perfect course to learn Python,without facing any trouble.The content is perfect combo of lecture & enough practice.All respected instructors(especially Joe and Scott)are so much energetic and enthusiastic.Their energy has kept me energized and connected throughout the course.The instructors have covered every smallest concept.Content is well structured to guide step by step.And Coursera is always a great platform to learn any subject."

664,"It's a great class for beginners. I had zero programming experience when I started. By the time I finished part one I had a pretty decent understanding of Python. The class is structured well, you don't need to download any software to participate, and the instructors are really great. They keep things interesting while being informative. I definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in learning about Python and how to use it."
665,"The course is a good start to understanding python. I believe it would be helpful to cover data structures a bit more to be useful for general python development work, however what it covers is suitable for the course assignments. Taking the second part of the course is really vital and I suggest combining them into one course. Only taking this first part would leave someone with an even steeper learning curve to advance their python skills."
666,"Absolutely the best course I have taken in Coursera, period. The content, the tools (CodeSkulptor is awesome), the dedication, the pace... There people have developed an strategy to introduce programing and Python that works to everyone. Not only you will end the course with lots of new abilities, but you will go through the course not getting bored or annoyed ever, on the contrary, waiting to go back home to keep pushing forward.
The best!"
667,"That's my first class at Coursera and on Python, and I found it to be consistent, fun and captivating. For me as an Objective-C programmer, this class is good starting point in getting used to Python. Throughout the course things get more complicated but nevertheless they remain interesting during all 9 weeks of the course. A lot of thanks to instructors who made pretty nice job, developing this course to be so consistent and funny!"
668,This is the first class I've ever taken throughout my academic career that I felt emotionally attached to. This speaks volumes of the instructor's ability to educate in an interesting manner and whet the appetite of their students for more. This course became a part of my weekly routine (*ahem* frantic Friday nights finishing up projects) and I really will miss it. Thank you so much to everyone who contributed to this amazing course.
669,"A very good introduction to interactive programming. The codesculptor interface cuts through the complexity of a full featured programming environment in a way that makes learning (somewhat) easy, while teaching useful and transferable skills. The instructors show the lessons in a thorough and entertaining way. The student forum was friendly and extremely helpful. All-around one of the best classes I have ever taken, on or off line."
670,This was the most enjoyable and rewarding course I've taken so far on the internet. It was excellently designed and managed by the very dedicated instructors. Fellow students on the discussion forums and on project peer assessmnet were extremely supportive and helpful. learned a lot and had lots and lots of fun. so did my family members who served as my test gamers. Kudos to the Rice teaching team. This course is highly recommended.
671,"This course is great under any point of view.

Great content, very well presented in clear videos.

Great exercises, that were useful and a lot of fun,and an awesome tool provided to execute them.

I am an experienced java programmer, and I really enjoyed following this course and I have learnt from it.

Anyway I would recommend this to people of any level, if interested in starting with programming in Python or programming games."
672,"I am a physics professor and a college Dean. I took this class to learn more about online classes and how they can be used to reach large audiences.

Yes, we can always learn how to do things better, but I will say that these professors are some of the best instructors out there. The course was very well planned and delivered with style. Now I need to figure out how to get all of my instructors up to this level:-)

Great job!"
673,"Awesom class. I took up programming as a hobby a couple months before starting this course. I has trouble learning from books and what was available online. I now feel much more comfortable with python, and have even started learning another programming language with the skills I learned from this course. The instructors are great, and their personalities are great for this type of class. I highly recommend taking this course!"
674,"Absolutely the best class in person or online that I have taken. The instructors are brilliant, but very down to earth. You were left with the feeling that making mistakes is okay, so long as you learn something from it, unlike most technical/engineering classes. Oh, and boy did I learn something! I'm now not only comfortable with Python, but confident in my abilities too. Thanks so much to the professors for offering this class."
675,"This is an awesome class to learn programming. The great part is that every week of the class, we get to build a working game. There is great satisfaction in programming something that is fully functional and working. The best part of this class is that absolutely no prior programming knowledge is necessary to do well in this class. The instructors are awesome and teach everything step by step. Highly recommend this class to everyone."
676,"The materials are well organized and well presented. I like that each week we will write a game. It keeps the class interesting, keeps me from losing sight of why we are learning what we are learning. I have so much fun in developing the games and feel so good about myself after I finish each one. The class provides an excellent entry point for any futher development. Thank you so much, Joe, Scott, John and Stephen. See you around."
677,"This a really great class! They make the learning fun while not shying away from challenging you to think beyond the lesson and extrapolate what you've learned to new scenarios. I was really happy with the way the course challenges you without resorting to trick questions or silly sneaky wording as some programming courses are prone to doing.

You'll have fun every minute of this class and learn a heck of a lot along the way."
678,"This is definitely a very good course. Very good material and very clever development environment, but best of all was the way the instructors motivated the students and divided the topics.

After 8 weeks you will end up with a good knowledge of Python and some simple game technics. I found it very impressive.

I strongly recommend this course. It takes from 5 to 7 hours per week to follow the course and do the weekly mini-project."
679,"Joe Warren and Scott Rixner are amazing teachers, who put an incredible amount of effort in this class. As a Master Student in Energy Engineering, i do not have much time for other courses: every other attempts in learning programming languages failed. Instead, Joe and Scott made me succeeded, thank to a really interactive and fun class. Now I feel ready to step up, i learn also more ""boring"" things, not just games. Thank you, really."
680,"This is best by the far the best course I ever took in MOOC. I went from no experience in programming to building my very own Asteroid game. I highly recommend taking this course if you have interest in learning Python. The mini-projects are fun to make and you walk out with a sense of pride after completing each mini-project, I know I did. Thank you Rice University and the professors in providing these course (Part 1 and 2)"
681,"This course is really great. I have taken multiple courses and personally dedicate time behind learning, somewhat self motivated. The lecturers and the course structure really makes it easier as the course is designed to keep you interested and wanting more of it! The course really covers a lot of topics and gradually build your skills while having fun. Would recommend this course to anyone, regardless of their technical background"
682,"I had some small experience with Java before the class but not much. It was very well structured to teach the material to a large array of skill levels.
Every part of the course builds upon the last, and the material ramp up is gradual and controlled.
The instructors are very set on making sure you learn knowledge that will transfer beyond the course. The only things that won't transfer are specific to the coding environment used."
683,"There is a very well-made course. You can get there a lot of training and enlightening advices from the teachers. Exercices get gradually more difficult and even if you may find some projects long or hard, I always had the feeling that completing them was within my grasp : never too easy, never too hard, just the good amount of difficulty to get you ponder over and over your lines of codes. I wholeheartedly recommend this course."
684,"Great class, very informative. I am a experienced multi-language programmer with really no specialization and this was my first time taking Python. I have never taken Object Orientated (OO) programming before and I felt that this was very informative. The class was tough, mostly around Week 5 and 6 with the introduction to lists and that had to do with the fact that I wasn't used to OO. Great experience and I am sad that its over."
685,"From the beginning of the class, the professors seemed fun and passionate about teaching the content. The course was very well-structured to the extent that anyone completely new to python could follow along and create games/applications. The creation of games/applications were complex in nature and very rewarding to complete. I could not recommend this class more highly to anyone looking to learn python programming from scratch,"
686,"I appreciate course structure, incremental progression and exercises so much more after completing the course. The commitment and effort of the instructors takes this course far beyond any books or instructional videos you can complete to learn python, you will learn programming, which can be applied to many more languages. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and highly recommend it to any one with interest in learning programming."
687,"Great teaching skills and a well-structured system for a progressive learning pace. Having already programmed before, I felt a bit too much held by the hand at times (not during the lectures, but during the exercises and mini-projects), but I know how hard it can be for beginners to understand where to start or where to go from a certain step.

Thank you to Scott Rixner, Joe Warren, John Greiner and Stephen Wong for this course."
688,"It is an excellent class!! I like how the lectures are kept at an average of 15 minutes each, so it doesn't feel like it's a drag to listen to it. Also, lectures are fun to listen to. I really love the fact that the exercises are progressive and codeskulptor is great! I like it better than my built in idle.

I missed the last two weeks of the class due to vacation, but I'm thinking of retaking this class in the future."
689,"Great class, very good for complete novices, but for experienced programmers as well. The lectures were done in a very geeky and engaging way, there was absolutely no PowerPoint or reading off notes. Personally, I looked forward for the lectures each week. The lessons learned can be used for both general development (they do introduce all the programming concepts you are usually going to use) as well as for game development."
690,"This is the best Coursera course that I have ever attended! Joe, Scott and team have made every attempt to teach the students in an effective and organized way! I really liked how the course materials, quizzes, and mini projects were organized and presented to us! I am really sad that the course is over, but looking for future opportunities to attend Joe and Scott's online free classes.

Regards,

Krishnadoss Parthasarathy"
691,"Counting all courses I have taken from in class and online course, this is the most enjoyable class I have ever taken. Joe Warrens enthusiasm with even the most primitive and simplistic games, is infectious. Scot Rixner's development of codeskulpter certainly provided an easy platform to learn and develop code. The lecture videos were well done: they not only kept my attention, but made me eager to watch the subsequent ones."
692,"Outstanding,

One of the best organized and coordinated classes that I have ever taken, and I've taken a lot of classes to get a Ph.D. in engineering.

The professors are doing an excellent job at explaining and introducing various concepts as the course progresses. The projects are fun and the support from the TA staff at Rice U was great. I learned a lot and I would recommend this class to anyone ages 11 - 65.

Nick"
693,"Yet another Coursera winner. The online CodeSkulptor tool was very useful - very practical as it removes the need for any tool installation. Nevertheless, personally I'd like to have the exercises working in an offline environment as well. The exercises were extremely well prepared leading us through a very logical development process gradually adding features. Would be nice to see some more advanced course from these guys."
694,"I enjoyed the class, and definitely can't complain about price. I learned valuable tools & concepts from the class. I enjoyed Scott & Joe, felt they were great speakers. The things I would of liked to seen improved are fairly minor. I thought we had too much focus on simple gui. Most of the challenges were figuring out simple gui, not python. The other thing, I think we compressed a little too much into later weeks."
695,"Great class! The lectures were informative and engaging. I found the class to be a challenge, but not overwhelming, because I quickly learned that between the lectures, practice exercises and forums the answers to my questions were all there. The class was a very positive experience and I learned so much about python and programming in general. I highly recommend this class to those who seriously want to learn python."
696,"Lectures and quizes were very very good, also the development process of the projects was very clear and helpful. People was really kind helping mates at forum.

I have to say that this course has been really interesting for me. I taught a little on python to my K students but with this excellent course my background to teach them has been really improved and I'm so happy and gratefull about that. Thank you very very much."
697,"I will certainly recommend this course to my friend! Thank you so much, you helped me to feel like a real programmer. And the result is always satisfying my ambitions, and that's great! The basic concepts of Python were introduced in a very original way. And just on this course I understood the OOP and all its advantages completely!

Fantastic course, I highly recommend it! For sure one of the best classes on Coursera"
698,"Excellent course. Well organized both in terms of content and delivery. Each week had lectures, quizzes and a mini-programming project designing a computer game. The projects included a basic structure and any really complicated functions to start with. We had to fill in the rest. A great motivator in terms of wanting to finish the projects to get your own game working. All in all a fun and interesting experience."
699,"It is a fun class, but it is at the same time very demanding. You have to take it seriously and really spend 7-8 hours a week to finish it well. Previous knowledge of programming and being a good high school student in math is necessary. It is definitely not a beginners class. I am programming from 35 years and couldn't get full score ate the end even I went through some quizzes a few times to top up my initial quiz scores."
700,"Excellent course. I had no experience in programming before this course. Now, I can even make a simple 2D game, just after 8-9 weeks of course. This course is beginners friendly. I also think this course gives solid understanding about what programming is. Also I think it's easier to start programming with Python. I've tried to learn programming on C# and Visual Basic but these languagies is not so good for beginners."
701,"Absolutely loved this class! The teachers were so so great, there were a lot of exercises to have a solid grasp of programming concepts, and the user interface they provided was extremely friendly.
I am also super proud of the projects I have learned to build in this course - I went from barely being able to run a few lines in Python properly to building full feature arcade games in a few weeks!! Who would have thought?"
702,"Absolutely amazing class with an effective teaching style. The instructors definitely give off a bit of a nerdy/geeky vibe and throw in a lot of tacky, corny jokes, but are great instructors nonetheless. This was the first online class I have ever taken and I can say with confidence this might be the best class I have ever taken. If you are interested in learning Python, I would say definitely take this class."
703,I'm not sure how to properly express my feelings for how educational and satisfying this class was. I have taken about 14 MOOCs so far and this was easily the best. Both the amount of material taught and the quality of the mini-projects are extremely high. I'm truly amazed by both how much fun this class was and how much I learned. I'm definitely taking any future courses developed by the Rice CS department!!
704,"After 4 years of college and 9 years as a professional software engineer, I have to say this might have been my favorite programming class I have ever taken. It was well paced, packed with great information, and I even looked forward to doing homework because we kept making fun games. This was a fantastic class and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. I hope these professors teach other classes in the future."
705,"Amazing instructors AND TA's. Really fun class, medium-to-hard for the total beginner. Will be much easier if you have just a little prior programming experience. Class focuses on building one mini-project game each week, and the way they have constructed the ascending difficulty level really creates a heightened learning curve. The last three projects gave me fits, but I still had fun! Well worth the time."
706,"In this course you will rapidly start building nice things that you can see working.

It's very nice to see that you have just built your own game.

It's highly recomended for newcomers to programming.

You won't learn highly advanced algorithms and topics, but you will receive a lot of reward for what you have to invest.

And you will certainly learn some useful techniques, to build nice programs and games."
707,"I 've taken five Coursera classes plus one EDX class going now, and this one was easily the most fun. And building video games using CodeSkulptor, simplegui and Python Language is a brilliant combination for a beginner programmer like me. I struggled at times but the discussion forums and email code clinic both helped pull me through the difficult times. I hope these guys create more classes. I'll surely enroll."
708,"If you have an interest in learning object oriented programming or Python specifically I can not recommend this course highly enough.

Joe & Scott keep the lectures interesting with their banter and the mini projects are well thought out and help you develop your coding skills while producing cool games. I still have a smile on my face when I watch my kids play the Asteroids game we built in the last project."
709,"Just a fantastic class. I was pushed to the limit of my patience and self confidence on what I could produce, but the reward to figuring out the projects and get them working was incredibly rewarding. Through the instructors' teaching, and useful peer assistance in the forums, I was able to complete the class and learned a ton about programming. Very rewarding and i was sad to have the class come to a close."
710,"Excellent introduction to programming. Course material is clearly presented and logically arranged. Some fairly advanced programming notions, such as classes, are introduced and are well explained and well integrated in the course material.

A very,very good programming environment. CodeSkulptor, is provided that makes the entire process fun and easy.

The instructors are first-class.

Highly recommended."
711,"Thank you all professors involved in preparing this course. I did not think I could make it this far, but I persevered and I completed the course. Not bad for a 70 plus old dog that wrote Fortran on punch tape for his first program and played with Apple 2e, 6805 micro and EPROM. The computer was a room full of valves and a jungle of wires. This course leap-frog me into modern computer technology. Thank you."
712,"Excellent class. I had some prior experience in Python (self taught), so the first two weeks were easy, but I got hooked. The remainder of the class was very interesting, challenging, and I learned a lot more than I thought I would have (even re-writing some of my older stuff). Excellent setup for distance learning, and great teachers. I would recommend to anyone interesting in Python, Programming, or Gaming."
713,"This class was amazing!!! I had so much fun with it. I have taken other programming classes before and learned some things here and there but this class really got through the best. The professors are extremely talented and teach in a very down to earth fashion and make the learning part, although more difficult at times, fun! I hope they put together another course because they really take pride in what they do."
714,"I am an experienced C++ programmer with very little python knowledge.

The course was a bit to easy for me, but I definitely improved my python skills after this course.

Also developing a new game every week was fun and relaxing.

Finally, the instructors are very good and are very funny guys, so you have the opportunity to learn new things in a pleasant and relaxing way which I haven't seen before."
715,"Amazing instructors AND TA's. Really fun class, medium-to-hard for the total beginner. Will be much easier if you have just a little prior programming experience. Class focuses on building one mini-project game each week, and the way they have constructed the ascending difficulty level really creates a heightened learning curve. The last three projects gave me fits, but I still had fun! Well worth the time."
716,This course is very good for people who are very new in python and want to take step-by-step learning of python. They have built a very comprehensive course structure with the course work per week being balanced. The quizzes and mini-projects are designed in a very good manner to make the student understand and learn the concepts taught in lectures. I would definitely recommend everyone to take this course.
717,"First, I would like to thank the instructors for providing such a wonderful course to us. I enjoyed a lot while taking this. The course contents were very simple and comprehensible. The quizzes and assignments were very challenging. But more than the technical contents, the way the instructors taught this class was excellent. Hats off to the Instructors. Coursera platform is one of the best I have ever used."
718,"This course is awesome! Really recommended for beginners and experienced programmers. Even I consider myself as a experienced developer, I learned a lot of basic stuff I didn't know and I didn't learn at school (that's maybe I wasn't paying a lot of attention). I can say that my logic for programming has become stronger thanks to all the content and advices being taught in this course. Enjoy! Greets from Mexico."
719,"Scott and Joe are great teachers, codeskulptor was great for interaction, and contents are really well-thought, not to mention their great sense of humor to make this class the best path for python learning!
I recommend any new beginner programmers to take this class, I am certain that you will feel as if you were physcally being taught step by step!
I am taking their follow-up course of computational thinking next!"
720,"Teachers were fun, didactics and all in all learning Python was really easy and most of all really fun !!! The mini-projects were easy to get done in time thanks to all the material available through the video lectures and the practical examples. Quizzes were sometimes more difficult to get a full mark but that's all. I hope other will take this course and I'm sure they'll learn Python in a second with fun !"
721,"Interactive programming has other possibilities for programmers and other ways of viewing programming. In my case developing applications in Java, C # and C ++ and I find a very simple language to learn and a very clean syntax. I really appreciate the support they provided me during this course.Everything was excellent, teachers, content and the provider, I congratulate it was wonderful to have taken this course !!"

723,"A great course, which gives a solid base for Python programming if you were beginner before taking it. Professors give well-structured and important information and, also, doing that creatively, what motivates to listen lectures and do assignments even better. Assignments are also very creative and interesting, making your own games is pretty fun! Coursera allows to create really flexible shedule for yourself."
724,"this course is amazing and well-organised, very helpful. It was my first time to take a complete coding class and I've really enjoyed it. Joe and Scott are really good teachers and they know how to turn some boring theory into attractive messages. And the mini-projects are really interesting as well. I would like to recommend this course to everyone who is interested in python. Believe me you will enjoy it as i do."
725,"I really loved this course, because the teachers were capable of showing us pupils how to do everything they taught with little to no problems at all, and they did it in the best way possible, by making it almost a game instead of a task.

It is really recommended if you want to learn more about object-oriented programming, or even if you just want to have some fun and show your computing skills."
726,"Excellent balance between video lecture, short quizzes, and weekly projects to keep you motivated and learning step by step throughout the course. The projects involve making games, so they are fun to share with family and friends, Although people with no programming experience can learn from this course, people with some experience will have an easier time. I spent ~10 hours/ week on this course."
727,"Exceptionally Great Class.

Well structured, well paced, with excellent teachers.

The lectures are sufficiently complemented by sound examples, quizzes and practice exercises.

You get a great amount of satisfaction after surviving the week and having completed the mini-projects.

Did not expect a Free Class to be this Great.

Best course/class I've been in and a good investment in time."
728,"This class was absolutely fantastic. Scott and Joe know their topic very well and did an excellent job presenting the information. All components of the class were very well planned out and extremely useful - the lectures, the quizzes, the projects, the discussion boards - everything is geared towards helping the student understand Python. If you're thinking of learning Python, this is the class to take!!"
729,"This class was great. Joe and Scott were great teachers. The spent a ton of time responding to students questions. I loved the structure of the class, having quizzes, video lectures and then mini-projects every week.

After only two weeks of class I wrote some python code at work in about one day that accomplished what I had been trying to do for a month.

I would take any class offered by these two!"
730,"It was amazing! I did enjoy studying the programming as never before: easy to understand, moderate to proceed, impossible to forget. Never have I seen so much fun in the project making and it was a real pleasure to watch Professors, listen to their advice and quick-witty jokes on each other. I recommend everyone to try it out, whether you want to improve your gamedev, Python or programming in general."
731,"Great class that clarifies basic topics on how to program a computer game. I've learned about how to properly draw a play field (i.e. draw handling), and how to control gameplay using keyboard and mouse, how to use lifespan of objects, how to create multiple similar objects, how to detect collisions and so on. If you ever wanted to start programming games this course will give you all necessary knowledge."
732,"This was a fantastic class that served as an excellent introduction to programming. The instructors were funny, humble, and worked extremely hard to make the class accessible to all kinds of people. Their enthusiasm for programming is contagious and they presented the material in a way that made it really fun to learn. If you are at all thinking about learning how to program, this is THE class to take."
733,"This was a great class that covered quite a lot of concepts. The fact that the programs we created for class were games made it all the more enjoyable. I've programmed for many years (but never in python) and I am happy to say that I've learned some tricks and things to keep an eye on that I can use in my code to improve it. I look forward to any more classes that Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen offer."
734,"I talked my wife into taking this class with me. What a wild ride :) it's been. Kidding aside, we both enjoyed the class so much we actually looked forward to spending Saturday afternoons together watching Joe and Scott on video and diving afterward into the mini-projects. I got so excited about the games i built i had to send them to my kids to play. What a pleasure. Thank you, Joe, Scott, John, Steven!"
735,"Great introduction to programming, I still cannot believe it did not cost a single dime. Even as a complete greenhorn I was hooked pretty fast and had a lot of fun programming. With the peer-reviewed assignments came a big surprise - I had not even one annoying comment on my code, EVERYONE was constructive and supportive if there was something do improve about my work. I really enjoyed this experience."
736,"This course is excellent. All the videos are well structured, funny and instructive, the forum is well organized, helpful and people out there are friendly and try to help each other eagerly. And also the other things, practice and exercise , documentation and demos. Thanks all the instructors, they are awesome, conscientious. Honestly speaking, everyone wanting to study python should take this course."
737,"Rather easy. But very engaging and fun. As a confirmed procrastinator, I found it really impressive how good a job the course did in pinning me infront of the keyboard, just fooling around for the sake of my own satisfaction. Best kind of education. I would recommend it to anyone, who's a total beginner. For anyone hoping to get some experience with any particular Python package: there's none of it here."
738,"This really helped me to start to structure the informal learning of programming I had found on my own prior to this course. Several concepts - event-driven programming, object-oriented programming, classes - I had heard referenced but had no idea what they were. Others, I knew a little from my own tests and explorations. But this truly gave me a big boost to continue my journey. Thanks to the instructors!"
739,"Yes, I completed the Part 1 and also the Part 2 of ""An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"". Very good course for Python beginners, very good organized (even for hard-working guys is possible to finish it). The instructors are great and it was a pleasure to listen and learn from the lectures. The quizzes and mini-projects are very interesting. So, you will feel great at the end of the course!"
740,"An awesome and committed set of teachers and a strong community are just the tip of the iceberg of this very well structured, engaging and challenging course . I just finished Part II but I think I do not realize as of yet how much I have learned, not only about programming in Python but also about time management, how to structure a project, division of tasks and self motivation.

Give it a Try!"
741,"I greatly enjoyed this class. The instructors were both helpful and quirky in videos so learning material was never dry. The pace was good and the practice examples help build upon the examples in the videos. The projects were very fun, making a simple game each week, which has been infinitely rewarding. But it can be difficult at times, and they do let you know up front that you will be challenged."
742,"I am a beginning programmer and I found this class challenging and fun. The class begins with the basics and builds by introducing new tools and complexity each week. The part I liked most was using what we learned to complete ""mini-projects"" each week. Although the projects are increasingly challenging, the instructors provided great exercises and examples that helped us be successful with the projects."
743,"Though I took programming courses in college 30 years ago, this was my first exposure to object oriented programming. Joe, Scott, and John are excellent instructors. I was leery of trying to learn a programming language via online learning, but they really have done a good job providing in depth, relevant information and good testing and exercises that make it achievable. I recommend this course."
744,"This course is really addicting. You'll bash your head many times, just wanting to get the mini-projects done so you can enjoy your game. Most importantly, it really teaches you problem solving skills. Upon completing the course, you will naturally ask yourself the question, ""How can I get a computer help me solve this problem?"" Also, you'll be well-equipped to take other courses in the Specialization."
745,"This is a course is aimed at teaching an absolute beginner how to program in Python while building a game. How fun is that?. At the beginning when you see the game you are expected to build it's daunting but as you take the course you see how the pieces are broken down. In the end, you get a game you can proudly show off along knowledge of Python. This is the best programming course I have ever taken."
746,"Really enjoyed the course. I was fairly new to Python but I was able to complete the assignments, sometimes with a little help from the course discussion forums. The GUI aspect of the course is what interested me. Developing some simple games was a lot of fun and reinforced the concepts taught in the videos. Would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in Python or developing games."
747,"I became obsessed to programming during the course! The mini-projects, though quite time-consuming, are very rewarding and helps to put everything learnt together. Both Joe and Scott are interesting persons with charming personality. Their conversations bring so much fun to the class. Amaze thanks to Scott for setting up the CodeSkulptor platform, which is really helpful to get things moving forward!"
748,"An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, or IIPP, is a wonderful course with enjoyable assignments, amusing instructors, satisfying results, and an all around amazing introduction to Python, and programming in general. I'm sure that any students who have completed or started IIPP will agree that this is a course every beginning programmer, along with more experienced ones, should take."
749,"A very good course to be honest . Yeah , and the worklload isn't that much . You can get almost instant help in the forums . One question I asked was replied minutes later. Also , the videos are very well organized and NOT 'boring' , as they contain funny content as well. A good course and encourage you to take it , I took it with no prior programming experience and got alot after its end."
750,"This was AWESOME.

My programming skills went from 0 to Dangerous (as promised)

A lot of fun, the instructors were great, funny, super smart.

the projects and quizzes were hard, but manageable, and super rewarding when you got it working

I recommend this course to anyone interested in making games, or programming in general.

if you pay attention, you WILL be dangerous

-Cloud Edwards"
751,"I had so much fun completing this course. The instructors have a relaxed, enjoyable style. Their passion and humour come through in every lecture. They're worked hard to make this course work. It's not for the faint-hearted. Many fall by the wayside but if you stick to it and work your way logically through the examples, exercises, quizzes and mini-projects, I'm sure you'll have heaps of fun too."
752,"Really reset my expectations for online courses and taking them seriously. My mood eventually went from ""Ugh . . . . . I HAVE to do my project...ugh."""" to ""I GET to do my project, and I just thought of a new way to really spice it up!"". From nearly missing deadlines, to nearly missing deadlines because I couldn't stop upgrading my code. Check it out, I'm glad I did."
753,"Great class! It willl probably be too easy if you've done some programming before, but even so if you are not familiar with event-driven programming it's a really nice introduction. The videos, exercises and templates and forums give you everything you need to get the projects done. Also the codeskulptor tool is a really awesome tool that makes it easy to get started and get working right away."
754,"Great course to learn simple gui programming. It is a beginner's Python course. I wasn't a beginner in Python, but I had no gui experience. Course was a lot of fun. Lectures were interesting and well done. Course material was released on time, every week. Coding interface (CodeSkulptor) was very good, and allowed for a lot of flexibility. Certainly one of the best courses I have taken so far."
755,"This class was fantastic! The lectures, quizzes, and mini-projects were all extremely well devised to add knowledge and programming techniques at a reasonable pace. It was a lot of work, but well worth the effort. The professors were clear as well as entertaining, and very available on the discussion forums to help get past any difficulties in understanding. All in all it was a great experience."
756,"This is the first online class I've taken, and the only negative thing I have to say about it is that I have a feeling any others I take in the future will be some degree of disappointing in comparison. I thought the instructors did a fantastic job and I would take any class they offered (probably even one in something I was already familiar with) just for the enjoyment of participating in it."
757,"This is a spectacular introductory course to the world of programming and Python. Joe and Scott are marvelous lecturers, finding a wonderful medium between making the course material simple and easy to learn and giving a thorough understanding of the material. They also inject their class with fun and laughs -- definitely a welcome treat. Beyond recommended for those interested in programming."
758,"Excellent course with top-class instructors. I joined this course after seeing their demo class. I haven't seen anything like this before. As for me,I know programming but average at coding. I could manage myself do the first three projects and am proud of it. Later on the projects became a little tougher and challenging for me, but still I tried doing it. Thoroughly enjoyed this course."
759,"A good class to learn the basics of Python. Implemented using their online ""development environment"", which is good because students don't have to struggle through installations on their own machine, but does leave a bit to be desired in python skills applicable outside of the class. Professors kept the lectures and projects fun and engaging, and the class had an active forum community."
760,"I've taken several free online classes, many related to programming. This was the best class I've ever taken. Joe, Scott, and John are three great personalities and educators. Each emphasized a specific area of expertise and played off of each other extremely well. It's great to to truly enjoy the educational experience. When I completed one week, I could wait for the next week to begin."
761,"I learned a lot about the Python programming language in this class. In fact, I started using what I know and teaching my 11 year old daughter about computer programming with Python. She started reading this book called Hello World! from Manning Publications that teaches kids about creating games in Python. Also, I may have he take this class depending on how well she does learning from the book."
762,"Wonderful class with instructive and helpful teachers, covers a lot of material on basic programming leading up to more complex game building. Whether you are mildly interested in programming, have no experience, or just want some enhancement on your previous knowledge, this is a great course for you. It was a lot of fun taking this class, and I recommend it to aspiring programmers of all ages!"
763,"I think this class is very good for beginners who want a fun and compelling introduction to programming. By teaching programming through making games, you get gratification by seeing your work up and running as something tangibly interesting and fun. The professors do a good job of explaining the material and making lectures interesting, and the exercises build well upon previous material."
764,"really great course to go through if you have almost no experience in programming and it is even more fun because you are creating games that you can show to your friends and be amazed by what you have comed to acomplished! Also have to say that the professors Joe and Scott just know exactly how to make it fun and motiviate you with their lectures.

i highly recommend this course! just loved it!"
765,"It has been very helpful for me to take this class. Although mainly focused on building games there's a bunch of python programming tips that will definitely be useful for other applications. I have to admit that could not complete all the assignments in time, but got so hooked to this class that finished them pass the deadline. Thanks to the instructors, Rice and Coursera for the initiative."
766,"Not to downplay any of the instructional videos and other materials (all great!), but I think CodeSkulptor really makes this class outstanding. CodeSkulptor is a programming environment that the instructors developed to make testing Python code easy and (nigh) platform independent - even better, it allows easy storage and submission of students' programs, *and* makes peer evaluation much simpler."
767,Very fun and enjoyable class. I did have previous programming experience so the class was a bit easier for me. One of the things I liked best about this course is that the assignments were fun programs/games that I enjoyed trying to build when I was first learning to program. The kind of programs I don't get to write at my current job. It brought that element of fun back to my programming.
768,"I really liked the way the topics were introduced in a logical manner and the quizzes and practice exercises. I ensured to do the quizzes and the practice exercises before attempting the mini-projects. This made it easier for me to understand the concepts. I also found the step-by-step instructions very useful.They were clear and unambiguous. Finally, it was good fun and highly satisfying."
769,"This class is great for both experienced programmers and beginners. No prior experience with Python is required to take this course and be able to complete it. Of course, having prior programming experience and/or experience with Python will enable you to complete the quizzes and class projects in a shorter time than otherwise, and probably to be able to take out even more from this class."
770,"Great class if you're interested in learning programming in general or specifically Python programming.

The instructors do a great job of breaking the class into bit size pieces. The videos, quizzes, optional practice problems and mini-projects made the learning both challenging and fun.

Much thanks and appreciation to all of the time and effort the instructors put into this top notch class!"
771,"Good experience! I really enjoyed the part I. I loved the mini-projects. Classes were easy to follow and you can feel quite ""dangerous"" after a few weeks from a beginner. However Part II is too tough, they don't really explain everything properly, many leaks of information and you need to struggle with every single line of the code to reach the mini-project at the end of each week. That's a pity!"
772,Excellent course that goes through the material at a good pace for beginners or those who may have a little experience in other languages. The projects were fun and you felt like you really were accomplishing things. Those with more experience/knowledge can extend the basic project to incorporate additional functions. Really great teachers who explained concepts well and made things interesting.
773,"It was a wonderful learning experience with Dr. Joe Warren and Dr. Scott Rixner. The video lectures, quizzes and mini-projects were very relevant to the course and provided an excellent learning opportunity. The discussion forums were also very helpful in interacting with the instructors and fellow students. I would recommend this course to anyone who is enthusiastic about learning Python!"
774,"I think the course and everything about it is great. The only thing that I would've liked to see is maybe a few slides or a pdf accompanying the videos/ important concepts. It was difficult going back through all the videos and finding the exact methods to call an object, for example, and a visual would've really helped for quick references. Other than that, I loved everything about the course."
775,"This class is the first programming class that I took and it completely changed the way I thought about programming. The interactive game used in this class is great and makes every week's project interesting. I felt I go home not to finish a homework but work on a game and that really makes my study experience different. Thank you Joe, Scott, John and Steven for making such a great class!"
776,"This is a tremendously well designed course. It is especially rewarding if this is one's first go at event-driven programming. I began the course with a few months experience in python already, and that surely made it easier going than it would be if one were completely new to programming. Like many have said before me, leave plenty of time for the weekly projects.
Highly recommended."
777,"This course was organized in a compact and clear structure, which makes it easily understandable for those who have no experience or weak background in programming. Also, all the professors and teaching assistants here are very earnest and enthusiastic on each problems that students encountered. I'm pretty sure that this wonderful course is worth and you will learn a lot from just a beginner."
778,Excellent course. I have never learned so much in such a short time span. I have taken a couple of programming classes at a university and have not learned or wanted to learn as much as I have here. This was my first coursera class and if it serves as a bench mark for what's to come next physical institutions have a run for their money. This class got me addicted to programming.
779,"I am retired and my son thought I would find a Python class interesting and beneficial. I hadn't taken a programming class since my Freshman year in college in 1972! This class was perfect! It was challenging, but very doable in a reasonable number of hours per week (8-11 for me). The lecturers were excellent. The course material was very well organized and presented. Lots of fun!"
780,"Introduction to interactive programming is an excellent way to learn how to programm. It teaches Python - a nice and clean programming language. Throughout the course you are building games, from easy ones in the beginning to the more complex and exciting in the end. Teachers of this course did their best to put together a solid and fundamental course, so it's definitely worth taking."
781,"It was amazing experience to take this class. Lecture videos, quizzes and assignments were all top class. Python programming tool used in the class (http://www.codeskulptor.org/) is simply awesome. It is unbelievable to see such outstanding and high quality courses being offered free of cost by Coursera. Thanks to the entire team! Please keep up the great work you folks are doing."
782,"Excellent class if you want to learn Python. Though this class uses a refined version of Python with custom modules that are probably not available in standard Python versions. its educative to the purposes of knowing Python and its capabilities. The instructors are highly lucid in their presentations are there are a lot of online tools (forums, etc...) to help you through the class."
783,"Class was well taught, engaging, and did a great job teaching a real and useful programming language. Be forewarned that the suggested time required is spot on - you WILL need 7-10 hours a week for this course! There are two quizzes and a coding project every week. That said - it is worth it. I learned a lot and am looking forward to the next offering from Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen!"
784,"This was a very fun way to learn how to program simple games in Python and was also a great introduction to object oriented programming. The professors did a great job keeping the videos to point while staying entertaining and engaging. I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning a computer language for the first time or someone who has programmed before, but new to Python."
785,"Highly recommended. Great Lectures. Well prepared. Great projects. Great people in the Forum. Codeskulptor is simple, yet effective. I built an Asteroids program, and I can tweak any aspect of it. I'm an engineer, 57, and this was a great way to keep my ancient programming skills intact. I will take any class offered by these professors. This is the best of my three Coursera classes."
786,"In this course you will learn python while enjoying making your own games, and teachers are funny. I really recommend it.

Aprenderas python de forma divertida programando tus propios juegos, y te los pasaras bien con lo profesores en sus videos a la par que practicas ingles (el audio, ya que los subtitulos los puedes poner en castellano muchas veces). Curso totalmente recomendado."
787,Course content is perfect organized in a increasingly difficulty level. Instructors are really funny and very resourceful which makes this class very interesting. We also get to make very interesting games in such a short amount of time which is really a confidence booster. I simply loved this course and definitely recommend this course for beginners as well as intermediate developers.
788,This class is awesome. The discussion forums are a tremendous resource when you are struggling with questions on quizzes and mini-projects. I definitely enjoyed the instructors and their efforts to make the class fun and interesting. I feel more confident with my skills and am grateful for the ability to have taken this course online from anywhere I could get an internet connection.
789,"Great course, the best tools, the best teachers and the best content for beginners.
It's really useful for some of you have no prior experiences about programming, I strongly recommend to all of you who are interested in programming and fearing it's too hard. It's so smooth and the learning curve is great in this course. There are videos, forums, exercises, and projects well organized."
790,"This class was both a great learning experience as well as a load of fun! It struck an excellent balance between being challenging enough to keep you going but not too challenging lest it be discouraging through excessive difficulty. I now feel very confident in my ability to code in Python and to continue to learn, and I have a great portfolio to share and continue building upon!"
791,"This course was awesome. The materials and assignments were all well organized and the learning curve was perfect. I went from basically no serious programming experience at all to being able to make a complex game and get into object oriented programming in 8 weeks. I have nothing but praise for this course, I loved it. I'm looking forward to taking another from these instructors."
792,"Excellent class, it will require some hard work if you are new to programming but there is a good support network in the class. Also at the moment each module finishes on a Saturday which means you need to work on the class during the week and not just weekends. The codeskulpter environment means you don't have to install anything on your computer to create pretty cool games."
793,I started 6 months ago to program in python with 0 knowledge on it with the only basic knowledge I gained at college (10 years ago). I was required to start automating our system in Telecom business and this course helped me to get into it and I used all the knowledge to develope a very good project...The course is perfect !!! Thanks guys for introducing me correctly to python.
794,"Thank you everyone for providing such a remarkable course this course was very helpful in pursuing my goals and dreams, amazing teachers and perfect course content which inspire and motivates the student to do more and complete the course content successfully.
I never thought i will get this far on my programming skills but thanks to this course i have made remarkable improvements."
795,"I had a fun time building games. I do feel that a lot of materials were provided by the course staff and that we didn't actually build games from scratch and on our own. This is, of course, everyone's personal responsibility: to go beyond what the course teaches. I myself, however, did not find the time necessary for such an endeavor, but I hope that I will in the future."
796,"It was interesting and challenging. We built awesome games, nailed it with Asteroids in the last week of the course. The assignments were rather difficult but you could ask for help in the discussion forums or even send your code to Code Clinic when you were stuck at some point of programming the assignments. There is nothing to be criticized about the class. It was awesome."
797,"As an experienced programmer that wanted to learn Python, I was not sure what to expected from the course, but found that it was an excellent learning opportunity. The course was well organized, the lectures were excellent, and the activities provided a challenging environment to learn. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in getting started with Python!"
798,"The class was delivered in a challenging way with an interesting proportion of teaching, ""hands on"" and FUN. The teachers were really good, and you could see and feel the experience in the class delivery. The mini projects structure was well organized, including steps and clear explanations of the requirements.

Love the class and would recommend to anyone else."
799,"A very well-presented course providing an introduction to programming, using Python as the language. They have created a fantastic online interactive Python programming environment which provides a basic GUI library to get a beginner involved with fun projects with visible results. For experienced programmers, this is a good, but simple, introduction to the Python language."
800,"This was an excellent class and a great introduction to MOOCs for me. I have a background in IT but have never used Python before so I found the early pace quite steady. This soon changed and the last assignment was a real challenge with plenty to get my teeth into.

Overall I would recommend this course very highly and will certainly look out for the follow-on courses."
801,"This was an AMAZING class! The pace and content of the course is challenging but that is also why it is so great. It pushed me to quickly process simpler concepts in order to grasp the more complicated ones. I finished the class feeling really confident and am excited for more programming classes and, especially, more programming classes with Joe, Scott, John and Stephen."
802,"This course is an incredibly solid introduction to programming, especially game programming, in Python. It doesn't really cover basic programming fundamentals, but it does take absolute novices to a point where they can program simple, impressive games in a very short period. The instructors really try to make the class fun and exciting in every lecture. Highly recommended."
803,"This course is an incredibly solid introduction to programming, especially game programming, in Python.

The instructors really try to make the class fun and exciting in every lecture. Highly recommended."
804,Great class to learn how to write codes for games. The one that I took had one small hiccup on object oriented programming but the professors have assured that they will take more time out for that and rewrite how they taught it to make it more easier to learn. I highly recommend this for people who are interested in learning programming and have lots of fun learning here.
805,"A superb introductory course in event driven GUI programming using Python. Suitable for anyone from beginners to perhaps people who program in othe languages but want to try some thing new.

I've been programming as a professional for over ten years and still took a lot from this class. The instructors really went out of the way to make the class fun and informative ."
806,"Very engaging, well-taught, and interesting class. Despite the online format, the professors do all they can to work with students and make it personal, even with a huge class. I feel as though I learned a lot about the way code is written. I recommend it even if you're not planning on learning Python and/or writing games, its a great intro to writing and debugging code"
807,Fantastic. Someone with no prior programming experience like me can progress quickly with programming games if you spend enough time in the course materials and are happy to do some googling. I had a lot of fun (with the pain of frustration too) while learning programming. This sure will be a stepping stone for any future work. Keep up the good work Professors Joe and Scott.
808,"This course is an excellent way to learn something about programming itself as well as something about Python, the programming language. As a regular MOOC attendee I have to admit this course among all that I have attended so far has found the best way to introduce course content to the students, that is knowledgeable and fun at the same time.

You have to try this course."
809,"Excellently taught. With the use of ""Code Skulptor"" on online programming tool, there's nothing to download or install. It's the foundation that this class builds on that allows even a 'never-programmer' like myself to go from Hello World to an Asteroids clone game. To say that this class is empowering is a huge understatement. I recommend everybody take this class."
810,"The professors put in an amazing amount of time and effort to turn this into a valuable resource. It's definitely built for beginners, and gives a lot of guidance about how programs should be put together and precisely what they should do. You spend all of your time thinking about syntax, and you don't have to worry very much about coming up with program design yourself."
811,"I think this an excellent course for folks that have some programming experience already in some language to learn Python - if you are hoping to start learning programming from scratch, this is probably too fast a pace for you. The creators of the course have done an excellent job on the materials, the programming environment called CodeSculpture, and the grading mechanisms."
812,"A very well-presented course providing an introduction to programming, using Python as the language. They have created a fantastic online interactive Python programming environment which provides a basic GUI library to get a beginner involved with fun projects with visible results. For experienced programmers, this is a good, but simple, introduction to the Python language."
813,"I can not do but recommend this awesome course on Interactive Programming in Python! Great instructors, lots of exercises and a hands-on mini-project at the end of each class. And last but not least, lots of help on the forum from fellow students, the community and the professors themselves. If you want to learn Python Programming, this is the place to be. You can do it!"
814,"I feel very confident in saying that this course is most likely on the very best ever introductory course in programming.
Unless you (unlikely) prefer a more formal and theoretic approach you will enjoy and appreciate getting very quickly code working doing interesting and motivating programs. And the instructors do an excellent job keeping you interested and motivated!"
815,"Great course. The classes are well presented, the content is totally well structured and fully related in a manner that will allow you not only to learn Python, but also develop very interesting and challenging games, using all resources learned during the classes. Joe ans Scott are great instructors. I really recommend the course for everybody who wants to learn Python."
816,The content of the class is excellent. I was a novice in Python but now I can say with confidence that I have learnt Python programming to a good extent and can further built on from here on the platform provided by this class. The instructors are excellent and they have explained to concepts very nicely and intuitively. I strongly recommend this class for Python beginners.
817,"It was an awesome course thanks to its simplicity and rich content. The Codeskulptor tool was extremely helpful in practicing what I've learned. The course material was enough to succeed in given tasks. More important of all, the instructors Joe, Scott and John were amazing and made this course very entertaining and helped us realize our potential in Python programming."
818,"I couldn't have picked a more engaging way to learn Python. The projects, and their underlying concepts were extremely well thought out.

As a result of taking this course, not only did I become proficient in an important and useful programming language...

...but I had a blast as well.

Bravo!

p.s.: Everybody who sees my implementations of Pong and Rice Rocks loves them."
819,"Clear material, good introduction to the Python language for both new and (somewhat) experienced programmers.
Enthusiastic teachers and fun assignments.
Codeskulptor environment works well.
Peer review mechanism works well. One remark: having to actively type 'None' in each comment box is annoying, even though it prohibits 'cheating'.
Teachers obviously enjoy what they do."
820,"I really enjoyed this class. I found the material to be engaging but not overwhelming. There are a lot of useful resources to guide you through it. I am looking forward to future courses that cover algorithmic thinking which (potentially) will make me more comfortable identifying a problem, developing a solution and implementing well.

Definitely recommend to EVERYONE"
821,"What a great class! It laid the foundation for future Python programming in a very fun and engaging way. The lecture videos and associated content were very helpful. There was enough guidance to help when you were stuck, but not so much oversight that you didn't learn anything. I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to get experience in Python programming."
822,I highly recommend both this class and the professors. The material was presented clearly and it was possible to work through each mini-project. The online format worked great for me as I did some of the work at very odd hours of the day. This course was not a 'breeze' even with the project templates that were provided and the hard work really helped me to learn.
823,"A beginner level class that is a must if you are starting into programming. The content of the class and the very idea that you can build your own games is awesome.

The teaching by Joe and Scott was good. The design of the coursework was progressive and many a time it was for me ""I didn't knew that"".

I loved the class and did learn a lot from it."
824,"It was hard to come home tired from work and start waching the course, but this guys made it really interesting and funny, and they have great teaching skills, i'm from spain and english is not my mother language, all concepts were underestood at first. That was a great communitcation skill and codeskulptor is a great idea. As we say in spain: UNA CLASE COJONUDA!!!"
825,"I just finished this intro to Python class and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning programming or learning Python. The teachers obviously put a lot of time and effort into building a good class and they succeeded.

I found it paced right, covered things well enough to understand, and provided extra support in the forums if you needed it."
826,"I think it is one of the best course i have ever taken.

The course content is well organized, the problem sets are although not very challenging but difficult enough to keep you hooked :)

And the biggest asset of this class is the awesome teaching style of both Scott and Joe.

I would definitely love to see more courses from them in the future :)

Thanks."
827,"Excellent course. Great teachers, great organization of material - not too slow, not too fast.

What is more important, you learn by writing games and not some boring examples as in most of the language programming courses.

This was truly better than I have ever imagined it to be. If you are interested in beginning learning programming, this is the place!"
828,"I found the class really enjoyable and useful. It teaches Python in an unconventional way. Each week we had to complete a mini project which is just an additional step to the final project that helps us to build a full fledged arcade game. All the instructors were very helpful. If you are interested in learning the Python language, this course is highly recommended."
829,"Firstly, both the professors have been excellent. There humour made the class a fun place to be. I m very grateful to them to teach me python. The way the programs were structured was amazing. The content of course was excellent too. Covering almost everything that a newbie would like to learn.

I HOPE TO CONTINUE LEARNING THIS AWSOME LANGUAGE.

THANKS A LOT!"
830,"This was a great class. I really worked hard to keep up, but it was worth the trouble. The problems were fun and interesting. The lectures and examples were enough to help me understand the material, but they left a lot of the analysis and problem solving for the mini-projects to me. I would recommend this class to anyone who would like to learn to program computers."
831,"I think with enough effort anybody can teach, but these professors are amazing. The class is just awesome. I have more than 15 years of programming experience, I can never match their teaching ability. The course has a smooth flow with enough information at each stage. I enjoyed it a lot. I am going to miss this wonderful eco-system of teachers and friends.

Manju"
832,Excellent resource for someone with programming experience to use to learn Python. The student community is very helpful in the provided forums and absolute beginners will need this resource to complete the course. The web-based learning environment is excellent and the Code Skulptor tool made it easy to build and manage the progression of the mini projects.
833,"Great class that I think offered significant benefits for beginner to intermediate programmers, and probably had a few gems for more advanced programmers as well, especially those not familiar with game development. The professors are genuine, knowledgeable and hard working, and CodeSkulptor is an incredible tool for learning programming. Well worth your time!"
834,"This is a great class: the codeSculpter environment is well built; the weekly mini-projects are both fun and at the right difficulty level -- not easy, but doable.

The instructors are just fantastic! I really appreciate the enthusiasm and good humor they put on this class.

I've taken several MOOCs, and this is definitely one of the best. Highly recommended!"
835,"Just an excellent course. Well paced and very well organized. Quite entertaining as well as informative. The projects are very well scaled with great scaffolding (template code) with enough challenge to make you feel victory with each one.

The instructors are all excellent and their personalities show through each lecture/demonstration. Just excellent all around!"
836,"This class was great, you learn a lot very quickly. It is truly focused on interactive programming, and so basic programming principles are only dealt with briefly. It really helps to have taken another introductory programming course before you take this one so that you already know programming basics. The programming language the course uses is Python 2.7."
837,"The content was very understandable and always came with practice excersises to better understand it.
The projects we had to do were explained in detail and were as hard (and as ""easy"") as they should.
The instructors were funny, I LOVED them. Definitely will enroll to other courses they teach.
Thank you for this beautiful journey. I'll miss you Joe and Scott!"
838,"I really enjoyed the course.
It was really well thought out and done, the instructors were amazing and the whole peer review system worked better than I could have imagined. I went from having very little knowledge in programming to building some pretty fantastic things.

I enjoyed it tremendously and would recommend it to anyone looking to get into programming."
839,"This was a really nice course on Python. There are no prerequisites, so everybody can start the course. It is fun and interesting to follow. It is also very useful. I really liked codeskulptor and the fact that the instructors give it as a solution to programming that does not require any other tool (just program in your browser). Very nice and useful course!"
840,"The video lectures were detailed and covered all aspects of the course. The quizzes and mini-projects were challenging but the students had ample resources to complete the quizzes and projects successfully.

Other factors that made the course interesting - Active discussion forums and Code Sculptor.

I sincerely thank the instructors for this awesome course."
841,"I am very satisfied with what these courses have brought me. Before, I had done a couple of tutorials which largely focused on python syntax, and after completing them, I still had no idea what I could do with programming. Although I do not intend on using Python to make games, this course gave me a glimpse of how powerful simple commands and structures can be."
842,"It was an exciting experience! Very interesting course with a lot of useful information and fun at the same time. Teachers are very nice and provide the information in a very convenient form. You have a right amount of theory and lots of practice which is great (cause you can't be a real programmer without righting code). Thank you, guys, for this great course!"
843,"Great Course. I had absoluteey no previous experience with any programming language, and while I cant say I'm now an expert, I do have a grasp on basic concepts of python and what can be done with it. The teachers are very good, they make concepts easy to understand and apply. Also, the materials and the way the course is delivered are very good and easy to use."
844,"Very good class and very much worth taking it. That applies both for people with and without programming experience. For those without any prior experience this class enables them to learn all the fundamentals and apply them pretty fast.

For the experienced ones, this is a good example to work their way through the Python and event driven programming."
845,"This is a great class. I took it on Coursera. The content is well organized and I was able to learn from simple stuff like print hello world all the way to manipulate class objects. The online python tool created by Scott really provides a homogeneous coding environment.

Highly recommended to anyone who takes interest in learning basic programming skills"
846,"Starts easy but gets progressively harder.

Excellent teaching resources, supporting activities and active forum.

Lecturers are loveable, geeky, hard working enthusiasts which comes over really well in the lectures.

Really a lot of fun but to learn everything they teach PROPERLY you could spend 20+ hours a week doing the stuff.

Absolutely recommended."
847,"Excellent introductory course for novices and connoisseurs alike. It introduces material at a fast pace and then gives you time to use it and get familiar with it through exercises and assignments. Getting stuck at times is part of the learning process and aid is readily available in the forums.

I recommend the course to everyone with a programmer inside."
848,"An excellent course in teaching python, to students of every level. It was both highly educating and very pleasant and the effort all the teachers put in making python understood and attractive is very commendable. A must for anyone wishing to learn, or improve their knowlege of python and object- oriented programming in general. I absolutely enjoyed it."
849,"This class was both informative and fun and a reasonably gentle introduction into the world of OOP languages. As an ""old-school"" person who learned COBOL programming on punch cards and teletype terminals, I was practically a novice, but I managed to get through with the help of the instructors and the students. I highly recommend this course."
850,"An excellent fast-paced course. The class was well supported by the instructors and built to really work well for both new programmers, and those just new to object oriented programming. The game format helped to keep things interesting while creating a platform to learn fundamentals of object oriented programming that could be applied to any program."
851,"Great class. Organized well. Using a web-based python interpreter, you wrote code a saved your work to a cloud-based storage system so that other students could later review your work. Weekly videos and code examples guided you along to completing the weekly assignments.

Kind of stressful at times getting the code to work but definitively worth taking."
852,"The class takes a different approach to programming by teaching to build games in python. This really helps, and it get a lot of us excited every week on what goes on next. In my 10+ yrs in the IT industry, I have seen very few courses that got me this interested.

Thanks to the professors and staff (and of course Coursera) who made this possible."
853,This class was amazing. I needed to learn Python to assist with testing tasks for my job. This class made it absolutely fun while challenging me to learn the skills I needed to be successful. Will I keep programming games? Probably not. Will I make use of the tools I learned - ABSOLUTELY - I already am and my job performance has improved tremendously.
854,"These teachers try really hard to be friendly and colloquial as they can be, and that's very important in an introductory class. They are super welcoming and they know how to teach! My Computer-science-degree-having husband could not teach me programming, but these guys pulled it off over the course of only a couple months! Oh yeah... /armed and dangerous/"
855,"The way it was presented was simple, to the point and was fun. The teachers are dorky but with that, they hook you and you just can't get enough.

You get a simple playgound for python and you just can't stop testing things out. A documentation link which just tells you what you need.

Fun classes combined with fun projects is a win win in my book."
856,"Amazing! To be part of a class of students from all over the world. The positive energy from other students that are willing to help you is contagious.

It is wonderful to sit all alone at your computer and still be part of a great group of classmates all doing the same thing.

Learning this way is definitely the future of education.

You must try it!"
857,"I have been in the IT industry for many years, and I am not new to programming. I initially started this class to learn a little more about Python in a structured environment. I ended up not only learning more than I ever thought I would from an introductory class, but I had a really good time learning it.

I could not have asked for a better experience."
858,"I took this class october - december 2012. It was well taught, covered quite a bit of ground and most importantly: it was very engaging. Their ""abridged"" version of Python, CodeSkulptor, was sufficiently similar to help learn Python but sufficiently different to facilitate a flying start. Thanks teachers, I learnt a lot and had fun doing so."
859,"One of the challenges of this kind of class is to proceed when you are simply stuck. I did not gave any Python experience but it was great to have two VERY COMMITTED teacher doing their best to motivate and educate thousands of people at the same time. As a conclusion I had fun, learned a lot and recommend this class for everybody interested in programming."
860,"Truly Amazing experience it was!!!

This class made me to learn python from application point of view which itself was plus point compared to learning programming languages just syntactically.

Thanks for such lecture videos series again.

I would rate this publicly as much as i can so people or my friends can take benefits of such lectures

Thank you!!"
861,"I had little programming, after this i gain a lot of understanding about programming. the most importance is that i had a lot fun learning. Thanks you Mr. Joe and Mr. Scott

for helping me to feel learning programming is not a burden but it is a very fun way.

For those had or no programming knowledge , personal i think this is the best course i ever taken."
862,The class was excellent! I loved every minute. I would recommend for everyone who would like to fall in love with programming. And special thought for teachers: you can get great ideas how to teach other people to program. Don't forget the course is the first in the row. There are two others coming this summer. The second was opened few hours ago. Hurry up!
863,"I just finished the class. I learned what I had expected based on the course description. What more could I ask?

The instructors were very good, only a little corny with their humor, but they are computer guys not comedians.

The class fulfilled my expectations and I would recommend it to all beginners looking to learn about GUI programming in python."
864,"I really like the lecture and the step by step build up of the course. I never thought that I would be building some of the mini-projects and when it is complete and working, I feel so great about it.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to take this class and consider myself as python programmer.

Looking forward to your future class offers."
865,"I've passwed several CS online courses so far and I have to ommt that this one was one of the best.

Really good presentation of material.

I enjoyed weelky mini projects, they were attractive and at the same time helped to study some new things.

Hope to see some advanced course from the same team of professors, prefereably on a similar theme."
866,"It's a fun class, and yet it is very challenging. The videos are clear and easy to follow. The mini-projects are doable and very interesting. I liked the way the mini-project gave you a lot of guidance and help in knowing how to do each step of the project. I enjoyed seeing how the various features of Python could be used to construct enjoyable games."
867,"This is possibly the best programming class I've ever takes, and I've taken quite a few. The instructors are passionate about their topics, and keep the class fun. The material covered is clear and easy to follow. And the projects are all games that are fun to implement. I highly recommend this class to anyone wanting to learn to program in Python."
868,"My review addressed to the newbies among whom I was, when had started this class. You should be absolutely calm and sure to trying it on. The content of this class is easy perceiving, interesting and very motivational. Never mind if you could finish it from the first attempt, as it happened with me. Try it again and your efforts will be fully rewarded."
869,"This is a wonderful course, but very challenging. The lectures and material are laid out meticulously and in a very effective manner. However, the level of difficulty increases over the life of the course and you have to he prepared to put in the effort and persevere. Otherwise, I don't recommend taking this course because it will only frustrate you!"
870,"This is THE BEST course I've ever taken online. The professors are really humorous, helpful, and it's a lot of fun to watch the videos and do the assignments. (we do a weekly project, designing different games) Programming might seem boring or difficult to you, but I think this course will totally change your view and you will have a good time in there!"
871,"It is a very informative course for students who want to study GUI , learn the basics of programming and watch a step-by-step game creation process. Thanks to the teachers, this class isn't boring at all. Scott, Joe , John and all the others have made a great job and applied all their superpowers (teaching expierince) to turn this class into fun !"
872,"Love the course. Love Scott, Joe, and John. I am a beginner in programming, but the courses (part 1 and part 2) are interesting and entertaining enough to get me through. I had a background in the Humanities, so you can imagine how much I struggled, but the forum is helpful, I was able to finish all projects. Feel like I have learned a lot to begin with."
873,"I have completed both Part I and Part II, and believe me the course is worth it. I really did not believe that I would build an asteroid game by the end of the course. But the course was perfectly structured that eventually we get confidence to program all the assignments. Great professors and fantastic content. A great intro to interactive python indeed!"
874,"This course is great for beginner and who has no IT background. You will be teaching some basic concepts. However, you are able to create simple game with these knowledge. Of course, you are able to develop to more complex version.

Last but not least, I would like to thank to all the instructors who made this happened. And, CodeSkulptor is amazing!"
875,"I really enjoyed this class. Initially I was apprehensive as I have some programming background in other languages. But the content is really well thought through and builds a solid foundation. The lecturers are great too, they clearly enjoy teaching the course and it comes across. SimpleGUI, the custom built platform for the course, is first rate."
876,"A great introduction course of python programming for beginners. Both the optional practices and the quiz are well designed to help me review what I've learned. I learned a lot and enjoy a lot in the mini-project in each week, though I got stuck many times in debugging the code. And the instructors are humorous, which makes the class more enjoyable."
877,"This is the best online programming course I've seen so far. It's very well organized, easy to get into and understand, and the lecturers aren't afraid of using some humour here and there - which makes the class that much more enjoyable.

Also - they have a unique online code tool which makes it extremely easy to write/edit/test/submit your code."
878,"Fully recommended for those who don't know nothing about programming, like I did.

Great video-lectures, with practice exercises and weekly miniprojects, and 1-2 quizzes per week, all very clear, and the help of forums and student-made videos abiut some particular points.

Of course it demands some dedication, even if I find it pretty esay."
879,"Very well structured course. I was a computer science major in the 80's. Although I have worked in related IT fields, I have not done very much programming in the intervening time. It was good to get some exposure to Python. The assignments were moderately difficult, but it was fun to achieve the results with actual games that you could play."
880,"Fantastic class!

I enjoy and learn a lot at the same time, really gonna miss the class.

The class is very flexible, I use to get the job for a week in a day, I only need extra time in the few cases I was stucked, but just because I enjoy and learn as well using the forums, videos, and all the helpuful material the course provide us to help."
881,"Best online course! It's the perfect mix of fun and learning. The lecturers are awesome and really enthusiastic about the course. The projects are carefully chosen and fun to work on. This course really gives you something to look forward to every week and by the end of it, you'd be addicted to it. An amazing, enlightening and fun experience."
882,"Really well organised and very supportive, exciting projects with code tips, code clinic and project walk-through to ensure excellent chance of success. Videos fun, relevant and well explained. Also many skilled and supportive students taking the course. Challenging quizzes and visual projects/games to create. Very pleased I took this course."
883,"Fantastic class!

I enjoy and learn a lot at the same time, really gonna miss the class.

The class is very flexible, I use to get the job for a week in a day, I only need extra time in the few cases I was stucked, but just because I enjoy and learn as well using the forums, videos, and all the helpuful material the course provide us to help."
884,"This is a great example of what you can do with on-line learning if you leverage the technology well and have enthusiastic teachers. I have three university degrees and have taken 11 MOOC classes and this was probably the most fun class I ever took, plus I learned a lot about event-driven programming. Five stars for Professors Warren and Rixner."
885,"Excellent - Don't let the price fool you...it maybe free, but the quality of the teaching and learning experience rivals a university class that goes for $100+ a unit. This class has a very logical and incremental approach to teaching interactive programming. The peer reviews of the mini-projects were valuable. Besides...the class is fun :)"
886,"Top notch course. Best online course I have taken to date. Well paced. Excellent tools, and fun programs to build. How many 8 week courses let me finish with a working game like ""Asteroids"" by the end.

I think the number of people who have taken the time to review show how much the course was appreciated.

Highly recommended!!!!"
887,"Well organized. A great deal of information presented in a short period of time. A class like this at community college or even University would take a full semester. Intro to Object Oriented Programming was something I had been looking for a while. This only piqued my interest. Looking forward to Joe, Scott and John doing more in the future."
888,"I am an experienced programmer and even quite familiar with object oriented design. So, my review of an Introductory level class might not be the most valuable. I took the class mainly to get a feel for coursera, to learn python and something about game programming concepts. I had fun and I feel I learned the topics I wanted to sufficiently."
889,"What a great class! This class I would recommend to anyone, including absolute beginners in programming. For those with programming experience who want to learn how to create interactive games using Python, I can also recommend this class as a fun and enlightening experience. The one word I would use to sum up this class - it's FUN!!! :-)"
890,"It's been a long time since I was worked so hard...and having such a rewarding and fun experience. From the starting gate, the instructors not only got us 'hands on' in a hurry, but furnished us with all the tools we needed. Multiple instructors also gave an opportunity to see the same concept in different ways. Highly recommend this course."
891,"This class was fantastic. The professors did an outstanding job with their lectures, quizzes and mini-projects. I was also impressed with the individual feedback they provided in the forums to students when they needed a little extra help. On top of all their great presentation of the class, programming a new game each week was just plain fun!"
892,"This was a great class! The professors did a great job recording informative lectures and providing detailed instructions for the mini projects. The online discussion forums were very helpful as other students responded to questions quickly.

I would recommend this class for anyone who wants to learn how to program in a fun and easy way!!"
893,"This was a great class! The professors did a great job recording informative lectures and providing detailed instructions for the mini projects. The online discussion forums were very helpful as other students responded to questions quickly.

I would recommend this class for anyone who wants to learn how to program in a fun and easy way!!"
894,"Great course! Without khowing anything about programming you could be able to program games in a few weeks. By making funny games you learn phyton.

The instructors helped step by step to learn more about phyton. The video lectures were mostly about 10-15 minutes so the you could always watch one even if you didn't have much time at one day."
895,"This course is probably the best introduction you can have to writing GUI applications in Python. The teachers are great and fun, the material is well explained and they created an interface to allow it to be easier for new programmers to start coding efficiently. Thanks for the great work Scott, Joe, John and Stephen. Thanks to Rice University."
896,"This is the best online programming course I've seen so far. It's very well organized, easy to get into and understand, and the lecturers aren't afraid of using some humour here and there - which makes the class that much more enjoyable. Also - they have a unique online code tool which makes it extremely easy to write/edit/test/submit your code."
897,"Very interesting course. Great presentation made by instructors, very helpfull excercises and quizes. Mini-projects chosen in very instructive way to allow students to master next step of Python programing. Code these games give me a lot of fun and satisfaction.

Thanks a lot!! I'm waiting for next step - new classes with the same instructors."
898,"I would definitely recommend to take this course. It is the best way to get into programming, even if you had never done it, and learn how to use a powerfull language to make your own programs and games. It is suitable for all levels, beginners included, and you will really enjoy the videos as they had made them quite enjoyable and easy-going."
899,"Fantastic! You learn how to program in Python and how programs are structured all while writing some computer games. The course will definitely challenge you if you are new to programming, but the course has many resources designed to help you. Definitely take it if you want to learn, and definitely fun if you already know how to program."
900,"An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1) is a very good course for beginners and mid-level programmers. Especially, using simplegui to build games opens up many opportunities. Prof. Warren and Prof. Rixner are very good in explaining new concepts and show many examples. The quizzes and mini-projects are challenging. Thank you."
901,"I had a lot of fun with this class. It starts with the basics, has good instruction - not boring, good examples , and practice exercises to get you ready for each week's game program. Even cooler is part 2, learning how to use object oriented programming to make better games. This was the first time I used OOP. It was challenging, but I got it."
902,"This course has helped me a lot in learning to program. Also, the instructors are really cool and funny, meaning they create a nice, relaxed and fun atmosphere when teaching you. The course hooked me the right away and it was entertaining and helpful from the first second! I have really enjoyed taking the course, and I am sure you will too!"
903,"I found this to be a great introductory course to Python programming. I hadn't had much contact with Python before taking it and now I feel more prepared to study on my own. Since I learned the basics with them, I can now go to other online classes or just read internet forums and write a code that actually does what I need done without bugs."
904,"I really enjoyed this course. The video lectures were entertaining, and I found all the material to be accessible and achievable. For reference, I had completed college-level calculus (almost a decade ago now), and had absolutely zero programming experience, although both my parents are programmers/physicists so they could lend a hand on occasion."
905,"This is an absolutely incredible course with great teachers. I joined this course when I have zero skills in programming and this course taught me a lot of things. I love every mini project that they provide in every week, I love how challenging the projects are and the feeling that you got when you finished the project is just incredible."
906,"I liked the organization of the course and the tasks which were there. I really enjoed the class and a bit upset that I finished the course and can not continue learning python with you. It was awesome to solve problems, find solutions. Amying course which I would like to take again and again, I will always recommend this course to all my friends."
907,The course is amazing!!! I am so grateful to the professors who put it all together and shared their knowledge! As a person who knew absolutely nothing about programming the class was challenging but really exciting. I am proud I've been able to complete the course and I will definitely recommend it to everyone interested in learning Python!
908,This was my first programming class in 25 years and my first MOOC but it was great. It helped me update my programming skills and recognize some bad habits I had developed from so many years of self teaching. It took about 5 hours a week and there was lots of help on the class forum. There was a good mixture of challenge and fun.
909,"My objective in taking this course was to get familiar with the Python programming language and I strongly believe it allowed me to do just that. I learned the basics of Python and object oriented programming in Python.

I recommend this course to anybody who is willing to put in 8-10 hours per week to learn programming in Python."
910,"This is really a good class. Although I did not have time to do the quiz and the projects. I wish i could have time to complete it later.

Thanks to Joe Warren, Scott Rixner and John Greiner who spent so much time on the class and i really benefit a lot from it.

I will continue in the future and introduce the class to more friends."
911,"This is one of the most interesting course I took online. I feel learned a lot after finishing quizzes, mini projects. The mini projects ask you to use everything you learn from the lecture. I have to say I cheer up every time I finish a project. It is not learning only, it gives me the confidence in programming most importantly."
912,"Excellent.

I have learnt programming during my under graduate school.But never really thought i could build a game myself.

This course made me to do it.Excellent video lectures and the discussion forums help you clear your doubts and obstacles.Whenever i am stuck i go to the forums and seek help.I recommend this course to everyone."
913,"This class is FANTASTIC! Having taken a number of high-school and college level programming classes, this is the best I have ever had. The teaching makes the material very accessible to anyone, and you will learn to program games.

I took this together with my 13 year old son, and he learned to program. It was incredibly rewarding."
914,"This class was my first venture into Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) and I must say Mr. Warren and Dr. Rixner have set the bar extremely high. Well written and well organized. The only thing, in my opinion, that is lacking is the use of files or databases to persist data. Thank you very much and I look forward to taking more classes."
915,"This class is a perfect example of the promise of online teaching, demonstrating what it can be at its best. After the 8 week class, I had learned so much more than I thought I would, and had a really fun time doing it. I am going to have withdrawal for weeks. Just try the class, you will be hooked right away and see what I mean..."
916,"Everyone who wrote earlier has said it - solid course, good introduction to Python, by use of game programming. Well paced and leaves one ready to tackle more.

CodeSkulptor is a brilliant piece of work - provided a uniform interface, - everyone had the same platform.

Kudos to Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner and Stephen Wong."
917,"I've tried to teach myself Object Oriented programming for years (coming from a structural programming background). Joe, Scott, and John finally were able to help me connect the dots through this class. They have put together a fantastic course that I would recommend to anyone interested in learning Python or just programming in general."
918,"Great intro to event driven programming and Python in general. Highly recommend even for intermediate programmers. The projects were fun, the guidance was just enough to help even the most beginner programmers along.

Probably one of the best ways to get into Python and to see what it can do in terms of games/basic knowledge."
919,"I was continually amazed at how much the instructors were able to cram into this class. I have learned the basics of a couple of languages, but this was the most organized and probably the most rewording class I've taken in any coding language. I highly recommend taking this class even if it's just to get a taste of what Python is like."
920,"The class was great. It was as demanding as a top online class should be. I learned a lot, although I am already a Computer Engineer. Teachers were extremely helpful and the material was perfectly introduced. Thank all the teacher for the wonderful experience. I hope all Coursera CS classes will have the same quality with this one."
921,"This class was fantastic!!!!! I am 51 years old and have programmed off and on for 30+ years. This was the first time I was able to really understand object oriented programming, as well as interactive programming. The course was smart, effective and really entertaining! I am sorry to see it end. It might be the best MOOC ever."
922,"Great course. I started with only basic programming experience and knowledge, and came away with a solid foundation in Python and a redoubled desire to continue experimenting with game building and other programming. The information provided was challenging yet accessible, and the instructors were clear and engaging. Highly recommended."
923,"I loved the class and recommend it to all those that what to start learning Python. By the end you will have great tools to start developing more advanced programs. Must also say that the professors are really nice and it shows that they put a lot of effort in this class. So if you want to start learning python, give this course a shot."
924,"The instructors are excellent and the course is very funny.

You should take this course if you want to improve your programming skills. Knowledges about programming are not required but it's useful.

However I think the content is too focused on SimpleGUI and you spend a lot of time trying to understand the API that won't use anymore."
925,"Just wonderful. But the mini projects have been rather demanding. Because English is my second language, I often misunderstood the directions. At first, I forgot to evaluate other students, and then found that I forgot to evaluate myself. It's OK. These often happen in the Internet. ""The net is vast in the Internet"". I'm a Japanese..."
926,"I've never taken a programming class before. I spent a lot of time working on the games for with class, but it's definitely been worth it. I plan to go into programming now because of how much fun I had writing my own programs. The instructors are great, the forum is helpful, and the content is challenging, but not overwhelmingly so."
927,"Great course- if you are planning to learn Python or want to improve your existing programming skills.This course is the best starting point. Content of the course is good, and instructors make sure that you start your learning journey from 'Hello World' program to more complicated games like 'Spaceship game' in an organized manner."
928,"This course is really great, particularly if you have no prior programming experience or at least none in Python/graphical game programming. The first part starts a bit fast but overall pace isn't bad. The graphical games provide a much more fun and tangible program then the usual text based programs in regular programming classes."
929,"Very good quality information and very well structured. The works assigned are made with a good progressive difficulty so it's possible to achieve the results without a lot of effort, and in the end one has learned a lot with the practice. Also the instructors are very accessible in the language and theory, and also fun. Recommended."
930,"Superb course, builds up nicely, lots of support/learning material (use them!) - like practice exercises and quizzes, etc. The nice, gentle humour presented by the lecturers added to the enjoyment. You might surprise yourself just how much you have learnt after only 9 weeks (5 weeks for Part 1, 4 weeks for Part 2 of the course)."
931,"I like the funny, well-organized teaching styles; I really appreciate the amazing CodeSkulptor and SimpleGUI created by Scott; and I had great fun implementing the mini-projects of funny small games. I definitely highly recommend this course, despite that the certificates are a bit expensive (to be fair, that's the provider's issue)..."
932,"This is really great course! I have never seen courses organised so good. Special thanks to instructors - Joe, Scott, John, Stephen. Guys you are awesome! I really recommend this course to people who are new in programming or in Python. However for people with experience it will be also fun. Thanks again! I am really enjoyed this class."
933,"The instructors are great teachers, they keep it entertaining but also give a lot of great content. They provide a development guide that makes the programming easier than if you started from scratch, this lets you learn more in a shorter amount of time. I learned a gob and really had a great time. I highly recommend this course."
934,"This course exceeded all my expectations and made learning python a fun experience. It was a privilege and honor getting to know the instructors, and their lighthearted humor had a way of keeping you engaged and always wanting more. I would highly recommend this class to anyone wanting to learn python or programming in general."
935,"Very interesting course, miniprojects are not boring. Difficulty was on perfect level for me (before taking this course, I knew only very basic things about programming). Course wasn't too easy or too hard, some mini-projects are a bit more challenge then others.
Generally, I'm very grateful for this course and I'm happy that i took it."
936,"Absolutely loved this course! Material was presented in a clear, organized way. Truly learned a lot and had fun doing it. Using Codeskulptor allowed me to focus on learning programming while not getting bogged down by compilers, Graphical interface complexities, etc. Scott and Joe were awesome. Take this course, you'll love it!"
937,"Wonderful course. The classes and mini projects were perfectly balanced in that they were tough but not impossible, and every tool you need to complete your assignments have been provided. They have code clinics, forums and (as a last resort) e-mail where you can ask about any problem you might be experiencing. Highly recommended."
938,"The course is well thought through because the instructors are very experienced.
I loved that I was getting not only Python but explanations and insight on programming in general. It was also nice that I didn't need to install anything on my machine - the required online code editor codesculptor.org works even on Google Chromebook."
939,"AMAZING ! First I almost hated the class - but it was my own subjective view - at times I thought it was too hard - but as they say a little patience and it will work!
I really liked it, it gave me confidence, and I think it had just right amount of challenge just the perfect balance of difficulty and help!
Amazing! Again!
Thanks"
940,"This was an excellent and absorbing course.

I was familiar with programming but I learned a lot in this course and I was able to do things that I was sure I was not capable of. It was an amazing experience.

Also I will be a better teacher from now on. I learned immensely about how to propose projects to my students!"
941,"This was excellent class to learn Python in shortest amount of time. I really appreciate the amount of time spent by Joe, Scott and other to provide us great content and video lectures on Python programming.

I recommend this class for everyone who is interested in learning python programming.

Student in this class."
942,"This course is very well presented, interesting and a lot of fun. The course creators seem to be having a lot of fun and their enthusiasm for the material is contagious.

In addition, there is a great deal of support so you always have a way forward if you get stumped by something.

I can't recommend this course highly enough."
943,"One of the best programming course I ever take.

If you are a beginner you will need to invest a lot of time to keep the level week to week

If you are a experienced programmer you will enjoy the topics and the materials

Lecturers are great , and fun, and achieving the mini projects encourage you to finish the course"
944,"This is a great class for getting started in object oriented programming and in interactive Python. The instructors are very effective teachers and committed to development of this and other MOOC courses. All of the class tools worked well, particularly their Python development tool, CodeSkulptor which was simply a joy to use."
945,"This class was interesting. Professors were great & I liked their style of teaching. More focus should be given to Python teaching code. Since I have finished a few mooc classes in Python and read a few web resources, I don't think I have acquired something new from this class, except from the use of Python in CodeSkulptor."
946,This is a great class. They have a great sense of humor and have put a lot of thought and effort into the progression. I was totally new to programming so this was a lot of work for me but it paid off for sure. There is a lot of help available when you need it. IF you're interested in learning Python this is the class.
947,"Nice course. If you have fun writing code and you want to experience with python this is the right class for you.

Pros: the way class is organized, the videos are great, homework are challenged.

Cons: the deadlines are sometimes to ""close"". so you really need to organize your time during the week to get things done"
948,This was a very high quality class that for me was just the right blend of support and challenge. All the topics presented were explained well and the projects were interesting and challenging but not so hard that they couldn't be completed. I would highly recommend this class and would take any other class they offer.
949,"This class was well done and and worth the time. I did find some of the assignments a bit difficult to start. However, after thinking about the problems and reading the forums I was able to complete everyone of them. I learned Python which was the goal but I also now have a much better understanding of how to program 2D games."
950,"This was excellent class to learn Python in shortest amount of time. I really appreciate the amount of time spent by Joe, Scott and other to provide us great content and video lectures on Python programming.

I recommend this class for everyone who is interested in learning python programming.

Student in this class."
951,"Had a great time doing this class. Lectures were very informative and surprisingly funny (the showdowns between Joe and Scott were definitely worth the class alone), and the mini-projects were both challenging and fun at the same time. Would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning programming, or just Python."
952,"Great class for learning the basics of Python and as a very seasoned developer, I got a lot out of it so it was not weak in any way. Thanks to the great instructors who might be a bit nerdy but had such passion and love of what they do - they really encouraged the students to keep going and provided a great deal of help."
953,"Wonderful intro to Python, Object Oriented Programming and using Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Lecturers are inspirational. Went from zero programming knowledge to building Asteroids game in 8 fun weeks.

Cannot recommend this course highly enough. Thanks to Profs Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Griener and Stephen Wong."
954,"Great course. Very easy to follow and understand. It takes new python programmers through the basic concepts, into event driven programming, and ending with object oriented programming. Everything is saved and accessed online, no downloads or uploading files is necessary. Very well organized and implemented. Recommended to all."
955,"I have never been in programing class before. And I think I can write decent programs. Last to lectures were very difficult for me. I almost give up how hard it was. But now I am glad I have finished.

This class give me solid foundation for programing in python. I can recommend it for any beginner or even advance programer."
956,"It was great experience. I really learned something new and I recommend it to the new and future students. I have twenty years of programming experience in various languages and this is the first class that is fun, rewarding in terms of new knowledge, and at the same time it gives us great learning tool - code sculptor."
957,"Engaging, humorous, short but thorough video lectures.

Challenging quizzes that illuminate interesting programming points.

Active, lively forum ensures that every question will be answered.

Program templates and development methodology provide guidance but leave plenty of room for students to figure out details on their own."
958,"Great class! Instructors did excellent job, very well thought off and concepts were easily understood and followed. CodeSkulptor is a great tool for learning basics of python and game programming. You gave me a kick off for a game idea i have for years but didnt know from where to start so i give you a bit THANK YOU for this!"
959,"By far the best experience I've had with online teaching. The professors were not shy about showing students how much fun they had with the material, and that actually made the material much easier to learn. The lack of a certificate is more than made up by the actual practical knowledge acquired from this class. Well done."
960,I had no previous experience with Python and needed Python a computation finance class. This class taught me enough Python to do the much heavier lifting required for computation finance. This was also a very fun class and I really enjoyed it. I would love to take a more advanced Python class either focused on GUI or analytics.
961,"Terrific class. Interesting, fun lectures, challenging projects (but not TOO challenging). I wish there had been a little more emphasis on Python as such rather than the GUI and custom environment in which class projects were done, but that is a small quibble. This is one of the best online instructional programs I have seen."
962,"This class was great. Really good professors that were excited about what they were teaching. Using a browser based IDE (written by one of the professors) we developed games based in Python. Starting with simple games, working up to a graphical Asteroids. This class was engaging, and just challenging enough. Highly recommended."
963,"This class is a great introduction to programming in general, especially for those who have no programming experience. It is also a fun introduction to game programming. The professors don't take themselves too seriously and really want students enjoy the class. The class discussion forums are very friendly and helpful."
964,"Each week I feared and also looked forward to the next mini-project. It was hard enough to give me a sense of achievement and certainly to challenge me, but thankfully there were ways of getting help when needed. The videos were great fun - masking occasionally a depth of information that the weekly quizzes then illuminated."
965,"This is a great class. The teachers are great. I have been a programmer for many years, but still I enjoyed watching each lecture of this class and completed each assignment seriously. The assignments are very exciting. Though this course is a introduction course, it did make me think of programming in a different way."
966,"New to programming, the class is taught in a very organized manner that was easy to follow. The projects were challenging but they were broken down in manageable segments and resulted in a good learning experience that was also fun. The highlight of this course is definitely the professors, who were personable and engaging!"
967,"Great class by great teachers! I learned a lot about Python and game programming in general. I think you can take a lot from this class if you are new to programming and also if you know quite a few things already.

The teachers were great, too. Lot's of enthusiasm and very helpful in the forums.

Thanks for a great course!"
968,"Excellent course- I just completed it after doing ""Learn to Program- the Fundamentals"" and found it both fun and challenging. The approach of developing games throughout the course keeps it fresh and interesting. I would recommend this course to anyone that wants to learn to program and build their own games!"
969,"This is a great course, i've learned a lot of programming trick, the best of all the course are the mini-project, because you can apply all what learned.

In every mini-project you are provided of a template, this is helpful because you can learn how to structure a problem, not common in the most of programming courses."
970,"Loved this course . I got to learn the Event Driven Programming from the basics and made wonderful games throughout the course. The way of teaching of the professors is great and to the point. Whether you are a programmer are not , with the great experience of the teachers , you still get to learn a lot from this course."
971,Without doubt the best introductory course to python I have found on-line. Precise and clear at every step and well supported for any difficulties that arose during the instruction. As someone with no Python experience and little to no programming experience generally this course has inspired me to learn more on the subject.
972,This is a great course! The approach from the instructors is relaxed and the content excellent. The mini projects is a lot of fun and worth putting the effort in completing. They teach at a good pace and you are equipped with enough knowledge at the end of the course to feel comfortable and continue with python programming.
973,"Really great. This course covers all the material really nicely, with fun projects each step of the way. The GUI, while basic, provides a nice platform to visualise the code, which is a problem with learning programming. I would highly recommend to anyone with at least a passing interest in Python or programming in general."
974,"An amazing class for anyone who wants to start programming for the first time. If you have never tried programming before, this class is a good place as any. The games make learning fun and interesting. Even if you do know programming but are looking to start learning python this a great course to take albeit a bit simple."
975,"There was pretty much to learn in this course for beginners and provided all the tools that were needed instead of asking the students to download the software. This is the highlight of this class, CodeSkulptor really helped in making sure everyone is using the same python version, could manage our files easily using cloud."
976,"This course is well structured, professional instructors will lead you through interesting topics of programming and explain all things in a very simple and understandable way.
It was a great and interesting experience taking this course, I definitely recommend this course for people who want to start learn programming."
977,"This is a really good mooc, both for people new at programming and for people who already know how to program in a different language (of course, it takes different ammounts of effort depending how much you already know). The week projects are well suited to apprehend the related contents, and the classes are quite fun."
978,"Greatest python programming course I ever learned, this course let us build many fun games, actually, building games make me feel great, I never build a game before, but now, oh, I build some game, this is unbelieveable, I do love this course, teachers are very intersesing and humour. Believe me, you will love this course"
979,Instructors are great. Thier explaination of the topic is clear and simple. I think that everybody will understand this course. Best thing is that you can learn something new in enjoyable way. During the course you create nice games even if you are beginner. The course arrangement took a lot of time and result worth for it.
980,"Great courses, I had almost no experience in programmng, took this class and put me right on tracks, now I am taking the other classes of these teachers and I am planning on finishing as fast as I can to finally do what I was hoping to do for years now and failed to do even though I spent great amount of money in books and etc."
981,Very good class to start learning Python (though I think that for those without any programming background would be a bit challenging). The class is well prepared and mini-projects interesting. Teachers are really great and do their best for students to succeed. I feel that I've learned a lot. And I absolutely love Coursera.
982,"Very great course, well organized, very good (and funny) teachers who seem to enjoy very much doing the course, as well as i enjoyed it. I started with no knowledge of python and ended up doing some funny games, and with some kind of proficiency in the matter. The best i had on online courses so far. Really recommend it!"
983,"This course is a wonderful point to start learning programming , especially python . During the course , you will learn bunch of fundamental stuff about programming and writing games . More importantly , with such instructors like Joe , Scott , John you will not bored even a minute .
Brilliant , fascinating , excellent :)"
984,"It was a great experience. I could review some complexes concepts and that helped me to improve or learn better. The projects were interesting and also matched with the course that's made me understand the concepts and memorize them. The course was funny some moments with the real dinamic of a classroom.
I really recommend it."
985,This is a very well structured and organized class for people interested in learning about coding and Python but who don't have much experience. The videos are able to be accessed as much as needed and there's questions throughout that make sure you understood what you needed in order to complete the quizzes and mini-projects.
986,"Python seems hard when you just started. However, you don't have to worry about this. Because these professors helped you a lot. They covered all the interesting part to finish your assignment in this class, even in the assignment description. I recommend you to take this class if you are interested in this programming language"
987,"Fantastic , fantastic course . I had enjoyed very much how i learning new things and get confidence in programming. Professors are funny (i think that most of professors are boring , but these guys are amazing. They worked a lot , I should recommend everyone who wants to learn about programming and interactive application"
988,Fantastic course. I've never been so hooked on a MOOC before. It's really addictive! I kept coming back for more and eventually completed the course in only half of the suggested time. Teachers are funny and very relatable. Their passion for teaching shines through! Congratulations to the team! I'm glad I've found this course.
989,"This course was fantastic and a great way to get an introduction to python. I work a full-time job but the class was totally workable in my schedule, educational content was top notch, and it was interesting enough to engage me despite the fact that I work full-time and have many other hobbies. Amazing job guys, great work"
990,"Thanks, all teachers and persons related with this class. I am a PhD student of material science from China. Since the COVID-19 virus, I have plenty of time to study Python and this class help me finish my starting of learning Python. It is really great! Hope it can lead more students into the programming in Python! Thanks!"
991,"This is a very well-organized, passionate, and helpful class delivered by Joe, Scott, and other staff from Rice University. I really enjoyed taking this challenging class and I really appreciate the time and efforts they've put into making this class happen.

Thanks again and keep up the great work!

- Helen"
992,"This was my first online class so not much to compare with. However, I have to say it really worked for me. The lectures were really useful and the mini project were really fun to do. Most importantly, this class made me understand some aspects of OOP, which I kind of knew for years, but never understood in depth."
993,"You can learn to code classic arcade games from scratch using Python. If you take this course you'll learn to do it in eight weeks (about 2 to 4 hours once a week), you'll learn to do it the right way and most importantly you will have so much fun you won't want to stop.

The quality of this course is outstanding."
994,"Great class. 5 stars are well deserved. The teachers are great not just in their ability to teach the material, but also in their values in spending countless hours to prepare and manage a great class for the world. Thanks a bunch. I hope they are reading this so they can know what an excellent job they have done."
995,"You learn so much about programming in python in this course and great for people new to programming and for those that are familiar with programming. You learn about the programming language python, GUI programming, and creating games! Highly recommend to everyone with an interest in programming or making games."
996,"This was a great class, esp if you are just getting your feet wet in programming or trying to do a refresher course. Both Joe & Scott are very passionate and great at explaining the concepts. The best part, are the games! You really can see your progress as you make more and more complex games.

Thank you guys!"
997,"My first MOOC course was a great experience. The flow of topics, minute details, exercises, quizzes and projects along with the lectures was an unforgettable experience. I went through all the video lectures, but I am sorry I could not complete some quizzes and projects, as I could not manage my time.

Chandrasekharan"
998,"Highly recommended. They tackle a simple, no nonsense approach to building games in Python. The projects are fun and very challenging. In fact, the entire class is very challenging and will certainly keep you on your toes.

Beware that the coursework and weekly mini-projects often required 8 - 10 hours per week."
999,Thanks for making this course fun! Joe Warren and Scott Rixner made this course interesting and explained complex concepts in a way that I could easily grasp. John Greiner's programming tip were very helpful. I started out with no knowledge about Python and now I can say that I can write functional program in Python.
1000,"just finished the class. incredibly well done. great information for any level programmer. instruction very thorough. very fun. instructors actually make the material entertaining. no small feat when you're teaching computer programming. plus, making games is fun as well.

doesn't get any better out there peeps."
1001,"This is an excellent class to start from scratch with Python, even if you have never programmed before. Even for somebody with experience in other programming languages, you get quickly into Python and it is very enjoyable. The instructors make a very good job for making the lecture both interesting and entertaining."
1002,"I must say that I TRULY enjoyed this course! That I was able to actually program a sophisticated game in only a few weeks of video lecture amazes me. Kudos to the Rice U professors who set the whole thing up: Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong. I wholeheartedly recommend this course to everyone."
1003,"Great classes with interesting projects such as asteroids, blackjacks and other fun games. The learning curve is not too deep, even for beginners. Most of the drawing, art works and heavy lifting work is provided and done by SimpleGUI behind the scene, so the programmer can concentrate on the game mechanics."
1004,"It is really fun course!!, and it is very well designed for learning.

I started without knowing anything without programing, but I followed all the classes just because it is very enjoyable to have the classes, and the programing assignments made big steps forward every week.

I highly recommend this course!!"
1005,"great course, great teachers, it's been a lot of fun watching their lectures, laughing with them, and learning from them. i knew nothing about programming, and this course helped me learn all i need not only to build simple programs and games, but also move on by myself.

i really recommend taking the course."
1006,"Signed up for the class not knowing what to expect, but ended up spending many enjoyable hours coding the mini-game projects. Not because I had to, but because I wanted to since they were so much fun and addictive. The professors all have a great sense of humor and you can tell right away they love doing what they do."
1007,"Definitely worth your Time!!!

Programming takes time and dedication. Having had just a little programming experience (over 20 years ago), the class was challenging at times. The instructors and other students were very helpful and supportive. Lectures were fun and engaging and the tools provided are excellent."
1008,This was a really great and fun class. The professors put in an incredible amount of work in preparing this course and making it simple and enjoyable. But they still managed to pack in a number of solid programming concepts. Highly recommended and I would happily sign up for an advanced course if they offered one.
1009,"I just finished this class.... I have to say that it's outstanding. The teachers have done a remarkable job in order to offer a A+ class in programming. Besides the topics covered at the class, it is very very fun to take. At the end I complete an Asteroids game. I shared to my friends and now they are addicted to it."
1010,"It was really good. Teachers did a great work and in the end of the course there is that feeling that we did learned something. And even more important than that is that we had fun with it. Can't do nothing else than recommend this course. If your new to programming or just want to learn a new language, take it."
1011,"This course was great!

Although I was not new to programming, I learned lots of valuable things.

The games you have to make are fun and the lectures are clear and highly entertaining. If you are new to programming, want to learn programming in Python and have fun, this is the course you are looking for!"
1012,Well put together. Instructors are passionate about the course content and bring humor to the lectures. so they are not dull. You will learn basic Python and create some fun little projects in the process. Highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Python or Object Orientated Programming concepts.
1013,"Absolutely amazing class!... I am a C programmer, so this was my first step towards learning python.... This class has taught me a lot, and has served as a launch platform for me to continue developing in python.... I would like to thank Joe, Scott and all of his team, for putting together such a wonderful class..."
1014,"The lessons, quizzes, and assignments are well-designed to teach students efficiently and thoroughly. I learned a tremendous amount from this course. Highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to program. Be aware that if you have never programmed before, this course is going to take a lot of time."
1015,"Very good class for the beginner that wants the first introduction in python.

every week you do a mini project that builds on the video lectures from that week.

you get a detailed step by step plan to do your miniproject, so after 9 weeks you can build your own full implementation of the asteroids game.

Very good!!"
1016,I just endede this course and i want to say HUGE THX to this guys bcz i get tonns of new knoleges and expirience. I had times when i thought that i will leave them bcz of hard programm but i took few days rest and turn to class with new power and finaly i ended it with good grade and tonns of new knoledges. Thx guys!
1017,"The instructors, Joe and Scott are wonderful teachers. I learned a lot from them. The way the course is designed, it's very easy to understand, even for people who never programmed before. I definitely recommend this course to people who want to introduce themselves to the use of Python as a programming language."
1018,"The content helped me learn to do things I never thought I could or would do. The tools were a great help. Many of the details that make a beginner stumble were made smooth by the great planning of the instructors. I wish there was a follow up offering to advance my skills even further. But, I am on my own now."
1019,"The content helped me learn to do things I never thought I could or would do. The tools were a great help. Many of the details that make a beginner stumble were made smooth by the great planning of the instructors. I wish there was a follow up offering to advance my skills even further. But, I am on my own now."
1020,"The instructors laid out this class well. The videos and the assignments were interesting and fun. I would take any other class from the instructors. I have worked doing systems administration for many years, this was my first class on game programming, I enrolled in the class due to my interest in learning python."
1021,This was my first foray into Python and it was really fun. I learned a lot and did a lot over the course of both classes. The instructors have a great chemistry and make the lectures fun to watch. I would totally recommend these classes to anyone looking to get started with Python or anyone looking to re-visit it.
1022,"I loved it. And that's an understatement. I have taken few other online courses but have never experienced something like this. If you have interest and perseverance to finish it on your own, then this is the course for it. Kindles the thirst for developing interesting stuff. Thanks Scott, Joe and John! Owe you."
1023,"This course has been an extra ordinary journey for me to learn Python and most importantly to build something out of it. I have previous exposures in few other programming languages, but I have never been enjoying coding as much as I did while taking this course. Thanks to the instructors and thanks Coursera."
1024,"great course - good balance between video lectures - practice exams and mini projects and peer reviews.
It looks like the new way how coursera is dealing with classes will make it less attractive. One basically has to pay coursera to tkae quizzes and mini projects and to peer review other people´s mini projects"
1025,"I highly recommend this course. I am new comer to python, but after taking the part 1 and part 2, I already familiarize myself with the usage of this language and I've built all the interesting mini games from scratch. Thanks to the funny and humorous teaching styles of Joe and Scott, I can make so much progress."
1026,I finished both the parts for this amazing course. I highly recommend this course to people who want to start learning programming in python especially. The course structure is such that you get to learn python and at the same time build games as projects and so you have a great bunch of take-aways from this course.
1027,"Awesome course! Really professional and excellent instructors. They teach you a lot of Python in a funny but useful way of learning. Each class, mini-project, optional exercises or quiz help you to understand and learn moer about programming in Python. An interesting and very complete course, 100% recommended!!"
1028,"I am a java, J2EE programmer. I works on front end too plus was using python's pyramid framework from last one and half year.

I just wanna say that there is a lot to learn in this course not just for the beginners but for programmers also and teachers are really very sprited and fun to be work with :)"
1029,"Excellent course. Everything is thought over from beginning to end. Very interesting, exciting, dynamic projects. Really enthralling and understandable lectures. Wonderful teachers, huge thanks to them. I highly recommend this course to all who wants to learn to program in a Python quickly and productively."
1030,"Great class - one of the best MOOC's I have taken so far. The instructors put a great deal of heart and soul into it and it shows. It is well structured, clear and really gets you up to speed with Python quickly. It's one of those courses where you a learn a lot while having fun. Highly recommended."
1031,"Very good MOOC

The best around for teaching programming games

in a fun mood and a very efficient teaching method.

Turn a novice in a good programmer in Python in 8 weeks that pass very fast as in a click of mouse.

Waiting for a ""second round"" maybe.

Highly recommended.

Louis G

from France"
1032,"I started this class with no experience at all in programming, and by the end I was making interesting programs and finding myself loving programming. I have to say I found the class quite challenging towards the end, but it was totally worth it. An excellent introduction to Python and videogame making."
1033,"I just finished up this class and i have to say it was excellent - the best MOOC i've taken (and i've taken a few) in terms of what i could accomplish afterwards.

The course finishes up with the learner creating a full game and definitely gave me the confidence and desire to go on and build more games :-)"
1034,"Excellent course, it was very helpful for my learning.

Before take this course, I've never had any kind of python knowledge, and now I'am confident that I can execute a project using python.

Tks all teachers that rich my knowledge: Joe Warren, John Greiner, Stephen Wong, Scott Rixner

Very thanks"
1035,"Great class, very good organization, perfect and easy to get access to Codeskulptor web-interface that makes it possible to continue learning and coding from any place: home, work, etc.

I would definitely recommend this class to those willing to start their programming career from the very beginning."
1036,"Excellent class to introduce Python and programming in general.

This course format gives an experience very

close to being in College and thats something that has been lacking in distance

learning. So well done Rice, Coursera and everyone involved.

Thank you everyone for putting in the time and effort."
1037,This was a fantastic class! It was taught by a group of professors who clearly love teaching. They made the class not only fun but they were able to pack a lot of information into a few short weeks. Highly recommended! I look forward to any other classes they may teach and to applying my new skills!
1038,"This was an excellent introduction into programming that was way funner to learn than ""Hello World!"". Thanks to Joe, Scott, John and Stephen for all your hard work. I learned a lot. The biggest thrill was playing the Pong I made with my 7 year old son. He's still asking me to play with him."
1039,"I would recommend this course to anyone. The instructors clearly put a great deal of work into this and the were great and it showed in the quality of the content. Some of the projects were challenging (not unreasonably so), but classmates and the professors were always there to provide support."
1040,"Great class, great instructors. Learned so much for free! Even the other students who graded my programs looked through my code to find issues and offer suggestions. The only gripe I have is that the videos often had problems visually (pixelated or random flashes of whiteness so the content was invisible)."
1041,"Excellent course materials, lectures, and very interesting projects.

I have a MSc in Computer Science long time ago and I think this is the best CS course I have ever taken. Not to mention that it is Free!

I used to believe that there is no Free Lunch, but now I believe there are real Free Courses!"
1042,"This is amazing class, teaching you Python and GUI programming. The course is fun - during it you will create series of games, from simplest to quite impressive. It doesn't require strong knowledge of programming language - the instructors will guide you through all the details. It's worth trying, seriously!"
1043,"This was a revelation. A real high quality learning experience where despite being at home on your own, you felt part of something. Whether you've programmed before or not, give this course a try. The depth of thinking that went into structuring this will make you appreciate what programming is about. Alan."
1044,"Really great class. I spent a lot of time on this class - probably closer to 10 hours per week than 7-9 because I came in with less programming knowledge than some. I learned string manipulation, list manipulation, set manipulation, OO programming and GUI programming. I made Pong! and Spaceship/RiceRocks!"
1045,"The class was a very enjoyable way to learn the basics of Python and event driven programming. You can tell the instructors put a lot of effort in making the course both informative and enjoyable. You will spend 5+ hours a week on the class but at the end, you'll be proficient in the basics of Python."
1046,"The class is just so much fun, it's a real satisfaction when you see a game come out of your hands so easily. It is perfectly balanced between regarding assignments, weekly classes, in general, workload. Thank you to the instructors for making it this way and for their friendly, encouraging attitude!"
1047,"This turned out to be a very enjoyable class. The professors kept it fun and in very manageable lessons. While the course was definitely at a beginner level, I felt I was still quite worthwhile to have put in the effort. I would certainly sign up if the same professors were to offer a more advanced course."
1048,"This is a WONDERFUL class. I cannot say enough about how much FUN I had in it. I haven't programmed in 15 years, and thanks to the efforts of Scott and Joe, I felt that it is the most productive work I have done in programming, perhaps, EVER!

Thanks, Scott and Joe. I loved every moment of the course."
1049,I have been programming for over 20 years and it appears that you can teach an old dog new tricks. I found this class challenging and fun. One of the best aspects is the review of other programmer's code. This peer review really opened my eyes to many different approaches to solving the same problem.
1050,"Before starting, I feared this course was going to be a big challenge because of my age, my poor programming background and my lack of time.

After having finished it I am delighted. Learning was profound and fun.

I want to thank Rice University, Proffesors Warren, Rixner, Greiner and Wong and Coursera."
1051,"This course was great! Till this point I have taken only 1 course in python - The Fundamentals. And when I saw the results in this class - making games - I was really happy. If someone told me few months ago that I will be making games, I would think he is crazy. But with this course it is possible. :)"
1052,Well run course lots of support. Challenge to new programmers while helping those with some experience in other languages get going quickly in python. Peer reviewing and quizzes add a learning dimension i was not expecting. Well worth the 2 hours per week needed to complete the classes and the projects.
1053,This course is great for those who want to start their adventure with programming or Python. But it is also great for those who want to start building interactive applications in python. The manner of the teachers is funny and really keeps your interest and you just want to keep going and improving.
1054,"Wonderful class. The lectures were divided up into manageable chunks, CodeSkulptor had excellent documentation, and the mini-projects were challenging without being overwhelming. I cannot recommend this class enough, be it for beginners or students with intermediate Python or other language experience."
1055,"It was wonderful attending this class. I will miss Joe and Scott.

I learned a lot from this course and I'm greatly grateful to my teachers for that.

I hope my learning won't stop here.

Those who like my opinion about the class should also take this class in future with them. Highly recommended!! :)"
1056,"Even after having a few years of computer science classes, I learned a lot from this course and had a really great time with the projects. The professors are dedicated and their energy and passion is infectious. I would recommend this course for anyone curious about programming games or learning Python."
1057,From the very start this course sets out to teach you practical programming skills. You will need to devote a lot of time though to complete the course. I think you will enjoy it because the teachers are so enthusiastic about their subject and try to make the course both instructive and entertaining.
1058,"I took this class through coursera and it was very well done and put together.

The games are interesting/fun enough to make the project feel like you're creating something cool instead of just doing homework.

All the videos were helpful, and I had a great time watching them and doing the exercises."
1059,"Great teachers, especially Joe and Scott! Each week is ended by quiz and mini-project. These mini-project was really funny. We built simple games where we use our knowlegde that we learnt during the week from published video lectures. I recommend this course for everyone who wants to start with programming!"
1060,"A great first class in that you don't have to install any software. In fact, you don't need to own a computer. You just have to have access to a browser - even at an Internet café.

Videos are easy to follow - and the project are fun -- they are all games which you are probably familiar with."
1061,"This is an awesome class for the beginner programmer, although you may find the acceleration in concepts towards the end particularly challenging. The support offered by the forums makes the experience very enjoyable though; and a necessity for finishing the course through to the end with full marks."
1062,"This course is very well-done. The few things I would change are minor, but the most major among them would be including less direction in some cases to allow students to do more of their own problem-solving. Overall, this was a great class that taught me many valuable things and was fun at the same time."
1063,"Amazing course! I've also taken a codecademy Python course, which was great but nowhere close to this one. Take both parts! They'r eworth it! I've seen some MIT luctures videos afterwards and, boy, how can people stilll learn things this way??? Rice IPP is light years ahead of MIT and the rest of the world!"
1064,"Fantastic, fascinating, well-thought-out and interesting course! I have been programming for quite some time and still found the course very helpfull and enjoyable to participate and even siply to watch).
Thank you Joe and Scott for this course, and many thanks to all who have made this course happen."
1065,"This is a great course! The material is both challenging and interesting and the way the instructors present it is innovative and fun.

The course is focused in python but the topics reviewed are transferable to any other object oriented language. It may be a little basic if you have programming background."
1066,"reat course. Suitable for people new to programming, as well as people who have some programming exposure but are new to Python. There are weekly multi-choice quizzes that have intelligent questions to make you think about the concepts taught. The weekly mini-projects are challenging and interesting."
1067,"Really interesting course for beginners, easy to follow, with motivating projects, good support, fun videos, and very nice teachers, specially Joe Warren who is just great. I could program before the course but I had no idea of object-oriented programming and this has been a very good introduction to it."
1068,"it was great, fun and informative.. by it's end I was having a blast customizing my own asteroids game, adding stuff and modifying stuff, I really think choice of making games as a medium for teaching the course was brilliant and is what kept me going when I was having trouble with finishing my assignments"
1069,"Amazing Course. I had previous programming experience in Python and other languages, but not in OO programming, and this course just nailed it to teach OOP. Great content, great teachers, and my programming level has really gone up after this course. Thanks alot to those who have made this course possible."
1070,"This is a great course for learning introductory Python. The projects are game-based, which makes the practice examples and mini-projects fun. The concepts covered in this course are directly translatable beyond gaming. The instructors are excellent and the videos and other materials are really well done."
1071,"First of all, it is a great course. It is hard to say you can find much finer course than this. The course gives not only knowledge on coding and interacting with tough lines of code but it gives you reason why you should code, courage for what you have done and understood, and passion for more to come."
1072,"It was a fantastic journey. It helped me understand python and implement code in a starting level, even though I have already known many of these things.
I am very excited with this course I do really suggest it undoubtedly to anyone want to learn python from scratch.
Thank you very for everything!"
1073,This course made me love programming. It made me to sit for hours and focus. I love the instructors and the way they teach. Overall they made me feed confident about coding in python. I recommend this course if you are a beginner to programming or you want to learn more about Interactive programming.
1074,"It was a very good course. Scott, Joe, John really helped us in understanding the concepts. Especially Scott was really good in teaching the concepts. Hope I will implement the things which I learnt in this course in my real time projects. Thank you all for this wonderful and useful course :) Good luck :)"
1075,"The course is so amazing! I began this course without any programming base, but it was so interesting that attracted me to finish all of the materials. The professors were always trying to make the lectures more fun, they laugh, tell jokes, and play games in the course. Anyway, don't miss this course."
1076,"The course is well structured with videos explaining different aspects and functions of Python and is then followed by guided exercises allowing one to check one's understanding. The tests, as opposed to projects / games at the end of each section similarly assist in evaluating one's understanding."
1077,"The course is really good. It's pretty interesting, but I can learn a lot of things about Python from the course. I really like the mini-projects, through which I can apply and practice what I have obtained from the course. Every time I built the mini-game successfully, I would have a sense of achievement."
1078,"I never programmed before and it was awesome to see the ramp up during these last 8 weeks. very enjoyable. the class has lots of exercises, and the class has many resources and videos. the subjects are divided by short videos. The professor is well trained and knows how to teach. I highly recommend it!"
1079,"This course was fantastic! The instructors are quirky but engaging. They know their stuff, and they keep things interesting. Each module builds on the previous one. The quizzes require some hand-on experimentation, which creates great learning opportunities. The weekly projects are fun and practical."
1080,"Even you know how to program nor you dont' this is a class where you'll get to know to simple computer games. Well explained topics, entertaining videos and a very well measured and increasing difficulty make this course a must for people who wants to get introduced in the world of programming."
1081,Great class from great teachers. They cater to all levels. They offer stretch exercises for the advanced and help for those just beginning. Wonderful course. I'm going to have my three teens take this on the next go round. Everyone can learn to program with a class like this and have fun doing it.
1082,This class is great fun but might be challenging for the complete novice programmer. I'd recommend beginners do the University of Toronto course Introduction to Programming to get a good foundation in writing good Python code and then do this one for moving to a higher and more entertaining level.
1083,Fantastic! I wanted to learn python but need some goal or reason to actually get started. This class was the perfect opportunity to get a jump start on using python for actual coding beyond the basics. Looking forward to adding python to my professional toolkit as a result of taking this class.
1084,"Extremely well done!

step by step, so it empoweres beginners to step into python programming, nevertheless it always remained challenging (at last for me as beginner)

and also important: always with a focus on FUN and humour.

Thanks to the whole team of Joe, Scott, John and Stephen!"
1085,Very simple to get started in programming with Codeskulptor and the quizzes and projects were very engaging and challenging. The content were very well prepared and delivered. Joe and Scott made this the best programming course that I have attended. They made it fun and non intimidating. Great job!
1086,Outstanding presentation and content! The Codeskulptor tool was invaluable for doing the lessons and was incredibly portable. I was even able to program the lessons on my tablet when needed. The transition from easy beginnings to more complex concepts and projects was great. Great Job Fellas!
1087,I found the class to be a very good introduction to Python and Object Oriented Event Driven Game programming. Projects are very well structured to guide you through them. Thus making something that could be pretty hard be quite doable. The Documentation on the programming tools used is very good.
1088,"This was one of the most fun classes! A really great introduction to GUI event-driven programming with entertaining instructors and mini-projects that were challenging and constructive. And with the completion of each project, you had a fun (if simple) game to play with. Highly recommended!"
1089,"Excellent course! This isn't just a walk in the park you will be challenged at times, but if you stick to it you'll come away with a solid foundation in understanding computer programming. And best of all, you'll have have doing it and you'll have something you can show your friends at the end!"
1090,A great class to introduce programming and Object Orientated Programming in particular. Really good instructors and a really nice online application interface for programming. Could not recommend it enough for anyone interested in this area and a possible module for in/out-school programmes.
1091,"The teachers have obviously put an enormous amount of time an effort in building this class: I cannot recommend it more. You should take this class because you will learn Python in particular and how to program in general, and you will have fun while at it. Highly highly highly recommended."
1092,"I think this was a great course. Extremely entertaining and very useful. I think the combination is rather uncommon. I highly suggest it to all of you. The thing I really appreciate is that you feel a sense of achievement after every week, you plunge into the interesting things really quick."
1093,"Have taken all the current online intro to python courses. This course is hands-down the best place to start if you are completely new to computer science and/or new to python. Also, since the programming projects are all games, this course is much more fun than the usual introductory CS courses."
1094,"Great class! Had a lot of fun while learning useful and very interesting things.

Personal note: Highly addictive class, every time i finished a project i kept going back trying to improve it, make the game even more interesting and fun so i ended up spending more time than the one suggested."
1095,"Great class, great teaching videos with a good mixture of humor with seriousness of the lectures. Good stuff feedback and great peer feedback and evaluation, through which you learn a lot. What can I say, I am looking forward for more advanced courses in programming games, with the same professors."
1096,I just finished taking this class and I thought it was great. The instructors made the course a lot of fun. The course was well designed to be accessible by beginners but it was also very useful for people with previous programming experience wanting to learn Python or get into GUI programming.
1097,"Best class ever!

Joyful, fynny, very interesting, challenging and fullfiling class!

Everyone should take this!

The teaching team is superb and i highly recommend anyone remotely interested in learing a bit of python or game programming to try this course!

It is an experience i won't forget!"
1098,great interactive online programming course with outstanding professors! They really cared about the students and explain things really well. It's easily accessible with the provided online tools and makes learning easy. Definitely one of the best online classes (and even normal classes) out there.
1099,"Great course! The course was well structured and easy to follow but jam packed with information. The teachers were great and enjoyable to watch. I loved being able to replay lectures on unfamiliar topics. The projects were fun but quizzes twice a week, not so much. Highly recommend to anyone!"
1100,"Great introductory class with videos and quizes that help to understand Python. Mini-projects, the most fun part of course, were really cool designed to learn each week new features. I learned a lot, actually more than I expected, even though I have taken some programming classes in college."
1101,Very good class. It is very well organized. Good teaching and a lot of fun. It's stimulating and gives you a lot of help so you don't have to do it all by yourself. The evaluation of the other students gives you the possibility to see that there are more solutions to solve your programming problem.
1102,"I tried a few other courses for programming online and this one was by far the best. It was engaging and fun. The projects were challenging but pushed you just hard enough to spend some time thinking about it and trying out new ideas. If you are just starting out, this is definitely the way to go."
1103,"This was a great course. In comparison to the other basic Python course I'd taken on Coursera, this one actually had you creatively making code early on in the course. It was very interesting, I learned quite a lot, and I'd highly recommend this to anybody who wants to start learning to program."
1104,"Great teachers make this a fun experience. If you like programming, or think you might, this is a good place to be. I have been programming for years and still found a lot of new knowledge here. In particular, I learned that game development is a whole lot easier than I had imagined it to be."
1105,"Excellent course. MOOCs are new and these committed teachers have got off to a great start. I've rated it 5 starts but that doesn't mean their version 2.0 won't be even better because these smart, humble teachers seem sincerely committed to keep learning how to design/teach better online courses."
1106,"Since the course aimed to cater the people at different skill levels by adding games as assignments and using (partially) homegrown CodeSkulptor, it should have some optional videos, syllabus & assignments for advanced students so that they can branch out their energy & enthusiasm."
1107,This was a great learning experience! The professors clearly did a lot of up front work and preparations to make for an excellent learning experience. It was also fun! The projects were interesting and motivational allowing for the material to be easily digested. I highly recommend this class!
1108,"Truly enjoyed this class, the lectures were not too long and never boring. Building the projects was at times a little daunting but satisfying upon completion when your game actually worked. Would like to thank Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner and Stephen Wong for building an excellent class."
1109,"Truly enjoyed this class, the lectures were not too long and never boring. Building the projects was at times a little daunting but satisfying upon completion when your game actually worked. Would like to thank Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner and Stephen Wong for building an excellent class."
1110,"This course gave me something I will never forget. As a computer hobbyist for many years I programmed as a hobby here and there, but never fully understood event driven and object oriented programming. This course afforded me a new level of understanding, that I am tremendously thankful for."
1111,"Job well done by the Professors at Rice University. My search led me to this course because I wanted to get more familiar with python; mission accomplished. I had a great experience and I really liked the layout of the lectures, quizes and mini-projects. Way to go Joe, Scott, John and Stephen!"
1112,"I felt that the format, pace, and difficulty of this class were perfect. It was pretty obvious that Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen put a tremendous amount of work into pulling this class off and it was very much appreciated. I learned a lot from these guys and am very thankful for their efforts!"
1113,"It's free, cover almost all basic topics of python, mixed with interesting mini-projects, codeskultor is a great online-ide ... the only thing that doesn't likes me was that all the exercises run only on codeskultor :-s ... but it's ok :)

Great work anyway.

Thank you for you time!!!!"
1114,"The teachers are dorky and loveable, the pace is good for someone with minimum experience while leaving enough room for more experienced programmers to implement and upgrade the programs. All in all I spent about 10 hours a week and found that more than enough time to finish everything on time."
1115,"Really hard work but very satisfying. Stick with it and you will learn loads. Just make sure that you have 15+ hours you can dedicated to it a week and an understanding partner, spouse, family etc.

Thanks loads to Joe Warren and Scott Rixner and Rice University for a truly excellent course."
1116,"A fun introduction to Python. It's a beginner level class, but I enjoyed it a lot even though I have programmed in other languages before. Depending on your level, it can be a lot of work, but the project you are working on are fun games, which makes you want to learn more and make it work."
1117,"This is a great, great course to learn object oriented programming concepts in practice. I enjoyed every single lesson and was really looking forward to each week mini project. Thank to Rice University and Course team so much for giving this opportunity to learn to me and to all the others."
1118,This is my third attempt at a MOOC and this one was by far and away the most entertaining and the best learning experience. The projects stretched me each week to apply what was on the videos. The scoring rubrics that we used to evaluate each other's work were powerful but also simple to use.
1119,"I have taken and completed several Coursera programming courses and this is definitely one of the best courses. The structure of the course does not assume too much about a student's previous skills with the material and still keeps the course moving forward each week, building on prior material."
1120,"Having no previous coding experiences whatsoever, I was able to complete the very challenging projects of the course (not all of them, but that's rather due to my schedule, and not because of the course structure). In general, very dynamic, funny and interesting way to learn the basics of Python"
1121,This course is a nice introduction in writing a game in Python. The guidelines for the programming assignments along with the templates are valuable helps in finishing the programming tasks. You should also take part 2 to get a first introduction into object oriented programming for beginners.
1122,Hello. This course is really well organized. All lessons are connected with each other and you cannot be lost here. Writing simple games in python gives a lot of fun. Teachers use great simple language and even... logic! Assignments are very well described. For me it is the best course so far.
1123,I have been taking a variety of online Python courses and the Rice University course taught by Joe Warren and Scott Rixner is by far my favorite. The knowledge and presentation of the materials is unprecedented. I will definitely be looking out for more courses by Joe Warren and Scott Rixner.
1124,"I liked very much your class. Instructors were really enthusiasts and they transmitted to me. Coursera platform is appropriate to share this kind of courses. Maybe it would be a great idea to create a course about the scientific tools of python as SciPy, NumPy, SimPy, Matplotlib and others."
1125,"Excellent course to learn programming using Python (which is one of the most succinct programming languages). At the same time, the course has lots to offer for experienced programmers too. Kudos to the course staff for keeping things highly structured as we progressed into more complex topics."
1126,This course has been great. Not only for the knowledge you get but the way the instructors teach. Joe and Scott are tremendous teachers and their guidance is exactly what you need for succeeding in the course. I really appreciate this course and feel that what I´ve learnt here is very important.
1127,"Great course for everyone who wants to start learning to code. The course goes with the perfect pace, every week adding new knowledge to you and challenging you to code more complex games. The instructors, support materials and coding environment are all amazing.
I highly recommend the course."
1128,"Top class! I'm working in IT and have tried many different online learning tools but this is the best I've seen.
I'm a visual learner and this class worked really well for teaching abstract concepts in a visual manner.
I'd recommend it (and already have to several people!)

1129,"Great, very likeable teachers creating a warm, friendly, humorous and motivating atmosphere. They really know how to bring fun into learning.
Good educational structure of the course lectures, materials and assignments.
I definetly recommend this course, especially to programming beginners."
1130,Awesome course and the style of teaching is simple Brilliant. I wish I had teachers like Joe and Scott who not only teach the theory but the application as well which really embeds the concepts in mind. I had an awesome learning experience and wish to have more courses from the awesome duo.
1131,The course is well structured. The content is useful and interesting. The mini projects are fun and relevant to the contents. The instructors present the materials well. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and will continue to take relevant courses from Rice University and the same instructors.
1132,Thanks to codeskulptor and his debugger this course is maybe the easiest way to learn programming. The pace of the course il also great and the content awesome. I also like the process of self-evaluation which allow us to notice how other students find solutions to finish the different projects.
1133,"I'm sure a huge amount of time has been needed to make this course seem so easy. The step-by-step method used helps to assimilate the matters and advance in the learning almost without effort.
There's a lot of support, practices... and there's also fun! I've spent a good time learning Python."
1134,"The material in this course is really basic and easy for the beginner. Great explanation and easy to follow from the tutors. If you follow all the tutorial in the videos, you'll definitely pass the course really easy. And you also have a forum to share and ask if you ever stuck in any case."
1135,"This is the best MOOC course I have ever took. I entered into the world of programming through this course. It's not a course that teaches you those basic syntax, instead they teach you how to build real things. Recommend for another following course I'm current taking: Principles of Computing."
1136,"This was an excellent course and introduction to programming. I had no experience prior and am now comfortable writing short/medium programs and understand the concepts. While studying over different syntax in other languages, I can easily understand thanks to what I have learned in this course!"
1137,"No matter what your skill level is, you stand to gain from this course in the most entertaining way possible! Scott and Joe did a fantastic job at not only the content, lectures and exercises, but also the support to keeping the course going. Check it out if you haven't. It's definitely worth it!"
1138,"Pretty good course, actually. Lessons structured smart and I have noticed myself getting to be more and more supported and encouraged to accomplish the mini-project from the first video-lecture through each week. I am grateful to all the teachers and intend to continue studying with them."
1139,"I love this class. It helps me to understand how I can apply my knowledge in Python in a real-world application. Thanks for Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Garner and Steven Wong. You have done the awsesome job. I liked all of the mini-projects and continue observing Python. Thank you."
1140,"I love this class. It helps me to understand how I can apply my knowledge in Python in a real-world application. Thanks for Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Garner and Steven Wong. You have done the awsesome job. I liked all of the mini-projects and continue observing Python. Thank you."
1141,"This was the first online course that I througly enjoyed and actually finished. The instructors are great, they have created a wonderful working environment specifically for this course. I highly recommend this course for people who have none or little programming experience before."
1142,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I thought the pace was excellent and the projects were interesting.

I've never been able to finish a self-teaching programming book, but this class gave me a focus which I followed through to the end.

It has hooked me on these free, online courses!"
1143,"I have been programming in the C language for 30 years, and I still learned a lot from this class. It is extremely well organized and you learn from every part of it. Even the Quizzes were learning experiences. It is so much fun too. I couldn't wait until the next weeks lectures came out."
1144,"I took this class to learn python. But I have learnt more than what I was expecting. A great course to learn and also covers lots of pythons and programming. It is very interactive as the title suggests.

I would really thank the instructors for this course. They were fantastic."
1145,"Excellent, excellent class! The instructors were creative, humorous and explained difficult concepts very well. You start with simple games and then end with a working version of Asteroids with sound effects and animation. I've taken quite a number of classes and this was the best by far!"
1146,"I've really enjoyed to attend this course. It was a great pleasure.

I wanted to thank our teachers, their explanations and advices were great and helpful.

I didn't think I will be able to develop a video game. Thank you CodeSkulptor and of course Scott.

Regards (from France)"
1147,Very fun class. My background is in embedded programming. I had picked up some python for various tasks on the desktop. I think the instructors make the classes enjoyable to watch even when some of the material may just be review. They have put quite a bit of effort into the classes.
1148,"This was a wonderful class. I already knew Python and some basic game programming, but this course made me work through a specific set of projects in measured steps and successful results, which was very valuable.

I would take the ""second semester"" of this if they create it."
1149,"Absolutely fantastic class. I've taken several online programming classes, and Scott and Joe have provided the best educational experience by far. Best of all it is FREE!

Whether you are new to programming or you're looking for an introduction to Python, this is the way to do it."
1150,The class is well structured and the teachers are great!! If you never programmed before taking this class will really help you to begin programming! If you already know how to program it still is a great opportunity to learn new things and improve yourself. I recommended it to everyone!
1151,The class is well structured and the teachers are great!! If you never programmed before taking this class will really help you to begin programming! If you already know how to program it still is a great opportunity to learn new things and improve yourself. I recommended it to everyone!
1152,"Excellent class, good for introduction to program in a more structured setting. Some exposure to basic programming techniques is helpful but not required (just have patience, the computer doesn't care about mistakes and will try as many times as you do). Thanks to the instructors"
1153,"It was great fun to be part of the class. Great thing is I was able to work on the assignments on my own, w/o any prior experience in python programming.

Discussion forums were so responsive and it was moving us if stuck anywhere in the right direction.

Great learning experience."
1154,"This class was so much fun! It covers a lot of ground, taking you from complete beginner through to some quite sophisticated object-oriented applications. The Codeskulptor interface is fantastic, as it allows you to jump right in and start coding, without any longwinded setup. Thank you!"
1155,This is an excellent world-class course in Python. Teachers are great and their way of teaching is very engaging. Course contents are designed in a very systematic fashion and offers a great deal of help and guidance to the student. I would love to learn more from them in the future.
1156,The class is excellent and the materials take you step by step process of finding your way forward. Both Joe and Scott are great professors and knows how to make the class both challenging and interesting. I learned a lot about python and how to use it in the building the program.
1157,"Very big thank you for this pleasant introduction to python programming language.
Despite my ignorance of English, I was able to follow this course pleasantly. The way to illustrate acquired by programming simple games is not only fun but also very effective. Thank you all the team!"
1158,"Highly recommended course for any aspiring programmer, as well as people who just want to learn how to program for personal reasons. This course will guarantee you the fundamentals of programming in a very well-structured manner! It is a must for anyone who wants to become a programmer."
1159,This is an excellent introduction to Python programming which gives you the opportunity to create some fun games. A bonus is that the programming environment runs in your browser which removes one of the major obstacles of similar courses which is the installation of a programming IDE.
1160,"This was a fun, informative, challenging programming class. Learning python by writing games was a good way to keep things interesting.
The professors were great. I felt like I knew them by the end of both sections. If you want to learn to program or learn to use python, or just"
1161,"I've taken some other online courses dealing with programming, and this one really stands out as a favorite. You hit the ground running making a new game every week, which really helped me stay interested and engaged. I'd highly recommend this course to anyone interested in programming!"
1162,"A great course with awesome instructors and content. Beware! this course requires a serious time commitment. I work full time and often missed the first deadline for the mini projects. Overall, a great experience and having games as mini projects made learning fun and rewarding."
1163,"Great content, it covers the basics but it goes fast enough that those familiar with other languages won't get bored. The projects are fun and help you understand better the ideas taught throughout the week. Good instructors and at the end of the course I felt like I learned a lot."
1164,"It is so cool to show the games that I build in mini-projects to my friends. And they love playing with them! The lectures teach you through all those important concepts, such as list, class, object-oriented programming, and so on. They are very useful in the following mini-projects."
1165,"Excellent course. I completed/audited both parts 1 and 2. Both are highly recommended as an introduction to Python. The instructors have the perfect mix of humor and seriousness. The organization is excellent, and many resources are made available. Thanks to all who made this possible!!"
1166,"Not much more to say than: perfect!

This course is fun, interactive, taking you from a beginners level to good level step by step. Teachers were awesome and managed to explain things that can appear complicated in a very easy to understand way.

I really recommend this course."
1167,"Nearly perfect class! Really, I consider this class to be an ideal way of introducing someone to programming in general, not just programming in Python.

Special thanks goes to the Rice U guys - their enthusiasm is contagious and their teaching approach is very lighthearted."
1168,"This class has been very well organized. Though, I had programmed (as a student)before, but never knew writing your own code for this games would be so much easy and fun. Thanks to the faculty for it. The course helped me to learn a lot and sharpened my programming skills."
1169,"The video's are well thought out and use quite a bit of humor to bring the fun of programming across. The material isn't easy but the video's and forums combined make the course very doable. This MOOC will take a fair amount of time for every assignment, but it's well worth it."
1170,"I found this course very, very interesting, it is well organized, the video lectures good and practical and the environment brilliant. The mini-projects was interesting and challenging

So I’m very happy with your work and hope that you keep on with your fantastic job."
1171,This class was fabulous. The instructors were extremely helpful with students new to programming in python. I received several email replies from the instructors when I was stuck at various stages of game development. I learned a lot and highly recommend this course to others.
1172,"This course went excellent and the professors are outstanding. It was my first coursera course, and all i can say is i'll repeat any course that these teachers give (if they give us the chance to do it).

Recommended 100%, don't miss it in the next period at any chance."
1173,"Great class! The professors clearly put a lot of time and effort into this, even building a web-based Python programming environment. They were also very active in the forums helping people with the projects, explaining concepts, offering encouragement, etc. And it was fun!"
1174,"It is a great class. The teacher is funny and engaging, the project is challenging and push you to learn. The forum is very active. I have learned a lot. I am thankful for professors' hard work and dedication. It is well worth the effort to take the class. Highly recommended."
1175,"I got into it with not much interest but I got really engaged, quite fun and really well built course. So in the end I dropped from other courses instead :-p

Highly recommended from people wanting to learn programming to experts programmers wanting to learn a new language"
1176,"The teachers are very fun and keep the content interesting. The assignments are fun and fulfilling to do, and give very good hands on practice with the recent material. If you're looking to learn python, or just get started with programming in general, this is a great option."
1177,"Revisiting programming after 10 years, I found this class to be spot on. The instructors are subject matter experts and keep the class easy and short. The assignments are progressively challenging and helps focus on key programming concepts and best practices.

Excellent!"
1178,"When I started this course I wasn't really sure that this will work. But the teachers did a great job, and the course was an awesome entertaintment. And now when I'm bored, I play with some of the games we breated and think in some others. Thanks a lot for this experience!"
1179,Excellent class with nice collaboration with people possessing diverse knowledge all over the world. Teaches python for novice programmers especially with simple explanations and cool projects at the end of the class. Really enjoyed. Thanks Coursera and thanks Rice University!!
1180,"It was very educational, and very fun learning to learn programming in python.

The video material, and mini projects are prepared very good.

Everybody that are interessted in starting to learn to program in python, THIS course is a good beginning.

You willl be sorry!!"
1181,"Well organized, and prepared course. It covers most of the topics I saw on python introduction books. I was illiterate for programming, but know I can say I have some idea. And to tell you the truth I'm going to take the same course the second time again. Well done RICE!!!"
1182,"Excellent course. As someone with some programming experience this class was really great, it covers the basics nicely and really gets you to a comfortable place in Python. One of the best things is the ability to expand on the assignments and find out more and learn more."
1183,"Glad it was 8 weeks long. Some jumps from one project to the next was challenging but great for those not afraid of a ""doable"" challenge. I will take this course again and, as a high school teacher, will use it to teach my students again as well. Enjoy, Coach Webster"
1184,"This course is amazing, so well structure, so much fun, and I learned so much! I had very little experience in programming before taking this course, but I was able to follow the material without too much trouble. The teachers are great, hope to see more of them on Coursera!"
1185,The course was excellent. The instructors were extremely knowledgeable about the topics and were very interesting to listen to. The content definitely was engaging and you really felt like you knew the topic at the end of each week. Coursera is a great platform for this.
1186,Good course. Each week's lectures build well on previous week's so that by the end of the course quite sophisticated applications can be built relatively easily. Lecturers are personable. The programming templates are useful for the assignments and for future applications.
1187,"A great course to learn Python...
Good material, sufficient amount of time provided, great support and fantastic teachers :)
I tried few other online courses before, but this one beats all..
Thanks a lot for the tremendous effort you guys had put in to make it a great course."
1188,"Very interesting and useful classes, simple and easy way to quickly learn Python with interesting mini projects, Teachers are very nice and responsible people, and there are funny game competitions, loooool~! Highly recommend ! Thanks for all the teachers and workers. :)"
1189,"Excellent course. I would highly recommend it to anyone stepping in programming shoes!
Moreover, the tool used to teach Python is excellent and online! No worries if you are at home, traveling, on vacation, at your friend's house, you can still work on the assignments. Superb!"
1190,"I just finished both IIPy and starting from NO EXPERIENCE and I am ending with a better, clear understanding of the subject. I feel competent to proceed to further my knowledge. I am more competent at reading material related to Python. So, thanks Joe, Scott, John, and Wong."
1191,This course is amazing! The ccoruse is well strutured and I genuinely enjoyed taking it. The professors are engaging and it was lots of fun. I felt like I was in college again and almost shed a tear watching the wrap-up videos. I definitely would recommend this to my friends.
1192,"A really nice course about Python, GUIs, programming and videogames. You can learn a lot even if you already know other languages (For example I've programmed C++ before) and with those nice teachers you enjoy the process of learning and you want to make even more games."
1193,"Absolutely fantastic, I think the teachers/professors really cared while making this class. It's broken down at a level where someone completely new to the subject can succeed. Thank you for making this class Joe and Scott (and all the others who weren't on the videos as much)!"
1194,"Great course. The gap between the lectures and the knowledge/level of understanding required for completing the homework is quite high, but there are very detailed instructions and practice exercises (when stuck, retreat to them, it helps in 99% of cases!) to help you along"
1195,"Great course! From 0 level to understand what is going on. I would say that it is little bit complicated to complete last 2 weeks at Part 2 for beginners and take much more time than expected and that is not so easy to combine with a work. Anyway Great class, Great job!"
1196,"I absolutely loved this course, I came to it knowing nothing about Python and have learnt a lot in the last few weeks. The instructors make it really fun, and yet challenging at the same time. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to start learning Python."
1197,"This course in my opinion is an introduction to gaming with python. Its a fun course. By making games, not only will you learn python but also the fundamental programming concepts and logic building techniques that you can apply in any other programming language as well."
1198,Awesome.. Professors are so dedicated to make students learn about python and their way of teaching is too good. The idea of creating and using codeskulptor in the class is the best in this course. I learned a lot about programming through this course. Thank you so much.
1199,Professors are really enthusiastic and passionate. Thanks for their teaching and supporting. This is an excellent Python programming experience. So it's very helpful for my understanding programming skills. I will keep going on Python and more. I really appreciate it all.
1200,"I LOVE this class. Really. It helps me so much, it makes me falling in love with python also.
I never know coding for interactive games before, when thinking for the logic, it maybe a little difficult, but it's challanging!
Thanks for Joe and Scott for this super class!"
1201,"I thought this class was a great learning experience. I would definitely recommend it. The material was presented in an easily-understood manner by the instructors; CodeSkulptor is a great tool for learning Python; and, if you stick with you, you are going to learn a lot."
1202,"Great course! Makes me love programming. At first, I knew little about python and programming, only passing my AP CSA. I didn't know how to apply my knowledge into real application. However, through this course, I got a lot of fun through how to really build a game you can play."
1203,"I think the instructor teaches very well and the course if laid out and presented well, but the subject matter is Python 2 which, while still out in the wild, is outdated since Python 3 is the industry standard and would give students a much better chance in the job market."
1204,"Very well done introduction to Python. Good programming projects that were fun and accessible. Nice sized lectures. Solid delivery. The CodeSkulptor tool and its libraries (which work on the PC, Mac, and Linux browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari) was a great tool."
1205,"This class in my opinion has set the standard for online courses such as this. For someone curious about this course I have two words of advice, ""Take it."" The course was truly well worth the effort, and the energy of the instructors made it incredibly fun."
1206,"Fantastic teaching, enthusiastic lecturers and a well thought out process. Allowed me to go from no programming experience to coding simple games in 9 weeks. Great community support and resources too. Took me approx 10-15 hours a week but I was a complete beginner"
1207,"This was an excellent class. I never thought that I will be able to learn so much in such a short time. But the class is so well designed that, you just have to spend time here and rest of the things happen automatically. Thanks Scott & Joe,for doing this."
1208,"Great instructors, great instruction, great examples, great IDE (CodeSkulptor).

Some of the videos were leavened with good humor. The assignments helped to reinforce the content from the lectures. The deadlines were reasonable. Writing the games was very enjoyable."
1209,"Excellent introduction to programming with python. Very well thought out class structure with fun and engaging weekly projects. I think they've struck the perfect balance of difficulty level and Codeskulptor makes this possible.

Great class, highly recommended."
1210,"It changed my life ... period. Joe and Scott were able to enhance my knowledge from noob level to above medium. I realize more complicate programs, I'm not afraid of using class, methods, etc. A big thanks to them. I hope they will make other classes in the future."
1211,"I would literally take this class again! Very hands on. Great teaching - really fun projects with lots of ""ah-a!"" moments. Best explanation and learning of OO concepts I've had. I can definitely extend what I've learnt to other languages and situations."
1212,"A very good course! The course is challenging, but in the same time interesting. In 8 weeks you really learns very much about programming in Python and programming in general. The professors do a very fine teaching with a lot of sense of humor.

Really great work!"
1213,"It was my first coursera course, and I think it was excellent.

In the fifth week there was a significant ""jump"" in difficulcy, so from this moment every Saturday night I spended working on my miniproject ;) But it was OK and gave me lots of satisfaction."
1214,"This class, while difficult for a beginning programmer like myself, was an absolute blast. Every week, you will be building a working game, and it's such a fun way to learn. If a 51-year-old housewife who has been out of college for a long time can do it, you can too!!"
1215,"This was a great experience.

The teachers were great, they were very professional, clear and concise.

I really enjoyed how this course was both theoretical and practical. There were video lectures and quizzes, but students were also given weekly projects."
1216,"Really great class. The teachers' passion and knowledge will lead you go through the entry barriers of learning programming. Besides, the projects are full of fun and well documented directions! You won't find any bugs that are too mysterious to have a clue at all!"
1217,A very good introduction course. Even I have been programming for over 10 years I still learn much from this class (Maybe I am not so good at programming after all :( ) I also think that it is a good starting point for people who want to learn event-driven programming.
1218,"Truly useful and fun class both for those who have just begin programming and for those that are more experienced with other programming languages. It doesn't only teach you to program in Python, but you will learn general programming basics taking this course!"
1219,"Absolutely brilliant! New concepts are introduced cleverly and used to make a good foundation for later steps. The video lectures are a great mix of introduction of concepts, examples and humor. I would like to recommend it to anyone who wants to learn programming!"
1220,"Enjoyed this class thoroughly. Had done some very simple programming and this helped me get going in a constructive way. Well laid out with the right amount of instruction and help, but pushing us to work through things ourselves. It was very well done!

George"
1221,"Really great class! The professors were great and funny, I learned a lot about python and programming. I recommend it to everyone who want to learn how to program, because Python is an easy and powerful language, and the classes and professors are really good."
1222,Informative and fun to watch class. Instructors are outstanding and passionate about the subject. One of the best classes I've taken so far on Coursera. Thanks a lot for all your time and efforts to make it happen. You've set a gold standard for future online classes.
1223,"Excellent class. Professors made the coursework fun and challenging, but do-able if you put the time in. Each week's assignment is building some kind of game, which made it fun to program, especially when you got to play the game you just built! Highly recommended."
1224,"This class was the most enjoyable programming class I had ever taken. I went into it not liking Python, and I was not sure I was going to complete the course. I had so much fun that I just kept going, and now I feel very comfortable with programming in Python."
1225,"I started this class without any knowledge about Python, and a little bit programming skills, and manage it. It took me more time then expected, so about 14 hours a week at the end, but it was worth while.

Thank you very much to Scott and Joe to put this together!"
1226,"Excellent class. First rate, highly professional teachers and back room staff. Great forums, great support. Taxing, (but in a good way), never dull always fun. Great sense of achievement finishing the course. I thoroughly recommend this course to anyone and everyone."
1227,"It is a very well organized class. I have learned a lot.

Also the way the projects are build, there are a lot of hand-holding from the structure. It might seem difficult at the beginning. However, the structure is there so there is not much debugging really."
1228,"Excellent course with easy, well structured and well supported study program. It does not take too long during the week to go through the class but yet you get to learn and write more and more code each week and great amount of understanding. Highly recommend it."
1229,"The instructors are very competent and very generous. I was amazed from the progress i made in this short time from having no experience in python to end up building those nice games! a great class, i recommend it to everybody who wants to learn programming in python."
1230,"The course was great, it was challenging and hard sometimes, but very interesting and useful. I like the instructors very much, they were teaching very well, and it's great that this course was read with a lot of humor, it was really fun and I enjoyed it very much."
1231,Excellent course! I'm a back-end developer so don't ever do UI (event driven) programming. This was a very clear way of learning the concept of event driven programming while learning a new language. The assignments were fun and greatly reinforced the lectures.
1232,I am just getting back into programming (after graduating with a Masters in EECS in 1983). I found the class rich in content and entertaining. The programming assignments were super challenging to me. The discussion forum with TA's and other students helped out a lot.
1233,"A great course laying down the foundation of python programming.

Only wish we saw professor's solutions so we can learn the right way. Grant it, there are many ways to accomplish a goal. Seeing other students' solutions is OK but I don't put much weight on them."
1234,"I think it's a very valuable programming course. Instructors, content and provider are at the high level. Very exciting lectures, interesting assignments, that will improve your skills and increase your experience in programming, especially, in building computer games."
1235,"Excellent course content for people who want to begin programming with Python. The best parts of the course are codesculptor IDE which works on browser and doesn't need any installation.
It also boasted a great discussion forum. I strongly recommend this course."
1236,"You obtain remarkable results really early, from the leading lessons. The lessons are clear and not too large (around 10-12 minutes) and the teachers are really mastered.
I hardly recommend this course for everyone that wants to learn Python without too much effort."
1237,This is a really great course. The content is perfect for those with very little programming experience. The instructors are really great and do such a good job of teaching the various components of interactive programming. I had a good time the whole way through.
1238,"Great atmosphere, encouraging results. Study complicated things with joy and fun. Well structured and organized. All you need to succeed is provided by professors. Just follow their instructions and rely on support of your peers. And you will have it done. Good luck."
1239,"Excellent course. If you have a lot of experience in another programming language you are going to find it is very easy to follow; if you don't, I think it will still be very easy to follow. Exercise instructions are very detailed, and the instructors are awesome."
1240,"Great class!!! excellent instruction and projects and meaningful quizzes!! I learned so much, especially from the TA's and mentors and the instructors are very funny and make the class that much more wonderful and easy to enjoy and learn from. thanks again!"
1241,"A very thorough course that makes a great start for beginners.
I've been struggling with learning programing by myself for about a year.
After completing this course, i can say that i have greater understanding on how to approach a programing challange.
Cheers"
1242,"It is the first course I took on Coursera, and it made me believe that online classes can be not just good but great. Joe and Scott are really good teachers and worked very hard to make the course fun and accessible for someone who had never programmed before."
1243,"The teachers are awesome! I like them all. I knew nothing about programming before, but after this class,I'm able to write some simple games! The teachers really put a lot of effort and they're very funny,so it's not boring at all! I really enjoy this class!Thanks!"
1244,"Fun class! This was the first course I had taken to learn Python. It is an excellent introduction to programming. It covers event handlers, GUI design, Object Oriented Programming and more. Yes, it is really fun. The material and tools are organized and polished."
1245,This is a course that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to get started on Python and building games using a GUI. Joe and Scott were the best instructors to help anyone get excited to learn Python. I truly enjoyed the class. Thank you very much! :)

Thank you Joe, Scott, John and Stephen for such a tremendous work. I really enjoyed taking this course."
1266,"This class taught a new way of thinking that I found could be used on things outside of class. While the projects were challenging I still took away a lot of information. With more practice, this could be the start of a whole new career opportunity for me."
1267,"I'm an experienced developer of 30 years. Taking this kind of class & staying up w it forced me to learn this language in a fashion & depth I probably wouldn't have done on my own. Highly recommended.

Wo says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?"
1268,"The best possible education, this course made me grow more and more interest in studies after i completed my educational life. You never know when you are studying or playing or just laughing out loud. After 8 weeks you just know that you can make games!!"

Perhaps it can be little bit overwhelming at times, but keep pushing!"
1350,"Great class! Easy to follow and I certainly had a few laughs just by following the videos. Very low threshold setup, because all I need was a web browser.

You've taught me how much fun I can have to write OO programs , thank you!"
1351,"Just a lot of fun. I have some experience programming but it was great to learn more about OOP, graphics and gui. The instructors are great and did a wonderful job preparing the course content. It's really incredible what they've done."
1352,"I really enjoyed it. The fact that every week we did a mini project which was a game made it really fun and I was eager to learn.

This class was tremendously useful to me and I would recommend it to people of all different skill levels."
1353,"The professors are really great. The class was a lot of fun. I recommend it to anybody interested in Python and or game programming.

The class has a pretty steep difficulty spike at week 6. Otherwise it's pretty straightforward."
1354,Awesome way to teach a language. I think building games makes it fun and very addictive. Awesome course. Loved implementing every game. Would like to see more bonus options in each assignment for people comfortable with programming.
1355,"I have to say ,although I'm an engineer ,and I rarely have time to design a game with python , I really enjoyed being in class ,and seeing Joe and Scott here with lots of effort that they make to this class was awesome.

Thanks guys!!"
1356,This was my first class related to building games. The contents were well thought of and class was nicely planned and executed. Me and my spouse both took this course and my kids played the games and ended up being the code testers.

Thanks a million Joe, Scott and other guys who helped to make this happen! And thanks a bunch to all my peers who reviewed my mini-projects!"
1381,"Wonderful class. Really enjoyed it. It focuses on video game programming, which is not my area of interest. But they use video games to teach broader programming concepts and Python in particular. And the games help make learning fun."
1382,"The course covered Python in a fun way. Each lecture series building on the previous series. The programming assignments were challenging but rewarding in that you get to ""play"" with the final games your create and share them with friends."
1383,Very good pace. Learned Python from limited exposure with the syntax to programming several working games. Lectures were relevant and entertaining. Instructors demonstrate a commitment to the class. I really enjoyed this class.
1384,"I enjoyed the class. Not only did I learn python, but I learned how to think in terms of interactive programs. By having assignments code various games, they keep the class fun as well as informative. I highly recommend this course."
1385,Overall this was a solid class. It taught me a lot about Python and programming that I just didn't understand before. Between the instructors and the course material I feel as though I have gained a good foundation to continue programming.
1386,Great teachers & technology (codeskulptor is awesome !!!) I definitely recommend this courser for both experienced and unexperienced python programmers. Video classes are very informative and learning from creating games is super fun.
1387,"dedicated teachers, community tas, skype groups, well organized materials, lots of resources, great video lectures, useful quizzes and a weekly mini project, requires you put some time into to complete but you will accomplish alot!"
1388,Best Python class by far. The instructors have spent the time develop an excellent class and learning experience. I would highly recommend this class to anyone looking at learning programming methods or anyone wanting to learn Python.
1389,I love this class! It not only taught me how to program in python but also helped me to understand clearly how the computer graphic and games code works. The teachers are fantastic in organizing the contents and showing us the ropes.
1390,"This course is the best! I can say so much positive about it, but I am limited by characters.
Materials - 5 stars
Lectures - 5 stars
Excercises - 5 stars
CodeSkulptor- 5 stars (viz mode is the most useful thing in teaching how to programm)"
1391,"The weekly coding exercises are challenging, yet great fun. It's made possible because of the great amount of work put into codeskulptor. I just wish they eventually build codeskulptor based on Python 2.7+. Python 2.6 is kind of outdated."
1392,"The content was comprehensive, the teachers approached the course from different perspectives, and every lesson looked like it was building towards some lofty goal while also letting the student get a sense of accomplishment each week."
1393,"Very simple material, but well-designed introduction to coding. CodeSkulptor framework and programming assignment templates make creating pretty games simple by the end of week 8. Appropriate for ages 10+, with parental support."
1394,"It was my first and unforgiven experience in Coursera. I love this guys from Rice! I recommend this courser for everyone who want to learn something about programming (there is a lot of mini games as mini projects, it was amazing)"
1395,Fantastic course! I'd highly recommend it... even if you're new to programming and/or games. The quality of teaching and content is excellent and very effective in learning the concepts and actually building games that one can play.
1396,I am so positively surprised by this class. I got much more than I expected to get. I can honestly recommend this class to everyone who wants to learn basics of python. You will get huge piece of knowledge served in very enjoyable way.
1397,"Love it , just amazing course never thought i will ever be able to write a game in python at end of Part-2.

please keep doing it course for lot more people to learn and be inspired a lot other people to have this kind of course online."
1398,"The instructors are great! They are really good in what they are doing and really funny too, so you'll learn a lot with them without getting bored! I recommend to all who wants to build a firm foundation in programming with Python!"
1399,"I really like this course, it has provided me with a lot of tools to start programming in Python. I had no idea about programming and now I think I can start to do some interesting things
Classes are fun while you are really learning"
1400,"Great course to become familiar with Python and visual programming. Recommend including additional reading references for students that will help them continue to explore the modules, tools and concepts being presented in the lectures."
1401,"Incredible entertaining MOOC. I have come with no experience in programming and got out feeling quite solid already. While being work-intensive, the IIPP course might be the best way to get started with programming in a very fun way."
1402,"I really enjoyed the course and learned a lot of python and generally about programming. The exercises and end-of-the-week mini projects are interesting and fun, which I think is a real plus over many of the tutorials and books out there."
1403,"This was an incredibly informative and fun course to take. I really enjoyed the approach, the videos (I loved that the professors seemed to really like teaching the course as well, and were interested in making it fun and approachable)"
1404,Awesome class. I have learnt so much during such short period of time. The teaching is very efficient and all the instructors have been tremendously helpful. Class is fun and easy to follow. Highly recommended to all beginner programmers.
1405,"Great class! I really enjoy Scott and Joe's teaching style. I like their jokes, their humors. And I really love codeskulptor, a good startpoint for python programming. Trust me, this course will be the best course you'll gonna have!"
1406,"Course content is precise, well structured and very interesting(always keeps you tied up and you're waiting to start next week). The best highlight of this course is the tutors. Thanks a lot for your efforts and time. Have a good time."
1407,"Just one thing, ""Awesome""
Go for this class, you will be a different person at the end of the class.
Instructors are great with their knowledge and teaching skills.
Plus, the content is awesome, holds for real-world applications."
1408,This is a great course !!!!!!!!!!!! It took me from a level beginner to a level where I can confidently say that I know coding . Its was a joy to take this class and I will continue to take programming courses offered by Rice academy .
1409,"Learned more, and faster than I've ever learned any programming language! The instructors are very good, knowledgeable and responsive to student's needs. I feel that I am so much farther ahead than I was reading from a text book."
1410,Interesting instructional videos. Good assignments that are relevant. Good support in online forums. I liked the peer review of weekly assignments. It helped that there is a hard deadline each week -- forces me to keep up.
1411,"This is a great way to learn Python without spending an entire semester doing it.

Coming in as a medium-level SQL and C++ coder, I spent 5-10 hours per week for 2 months and now consider myself an excellent Python programmer."
1412,"I knew little bit of python, some php and javascript, but never done any OOP. This course helped me a lot to understand concepts of OOP and start using it not only in python, but to understand it in other languages as well"
1413,Great online learning opportunity for those who never programmed in Python before. I highly recommend taking this course in order to assess your inner will to start learning programming in Python. Thanks to the instructors.
1414,"I really enjoyed this course, it was well delivered with interesting examples and useful programming tips. Along the way we created a pong game, a simple memory game, a blackjack game, and wound up with an asteroids-like game."
1415,It's a great class. I really love the way the instructors present materials. They talk about each single subject in a clear and fun style. You will definitely be proud of yourself after you build up your own code for those games!
1416,"Great course, great teachers. Right from the start i thought that i couldn't to build the game, but as closer to end of class i realized that it's not hard that i thought. Thanks for all teahcers of this class. You're best!"
1417,"Brilliant class! Having almost no previous programming experience, I found this class a nice way of getting in to Python. Next step is to get stuff working outside CodeSculptor, but that should be possible :)

Great teachers!"
1418,"Fantastic! This is the best Coursera course I've taken so far. The teachers, the content, it was all great. I've already pointed some code-curious friends and family at this course. Well done, Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen!"
1419,"Great introduction to python!

They are really dedicated to the videos and information presented. They built a great sandbox for you to play with python in a controlled environment. They have fun and keep the material 'exciting'."
1420,Fantastic course...absolutely got obsessed with Python over this period of around 3 months. Built some good games and learnt a lot of new things from peers. The journey throughout was exciting and fun. Thanks to all professors!
1421,I can imagine how much effort were put to create this course. And it's made with love! Instructors clearly enjoy what they're doing and share it with students. I got addicted to this course starting from the first lecture.

1614,"I thought it was great (and I've managed other MOOCs, starting way back in the MOO days). My only complaint to the instructors was that I wanted until Sunday evening to complete assignments (an extra day)."
1615,"Great for beginners. Lots of information.

The time consumed thinking about physics or geometry for the games implementations, rather than programming, should be less. Minor importance matter, though."
1616,This is an excellent introduction to Python programming. Joe and Scott are great instructors. The only negative I can think of is that there is no follow-up advanced Python class. Thanks Rice and Coursera!
1617,"Fun and very well presented, I learned a lot and

had small successes every week by making games.

Until this class, I had not even a clue how to make

a game, and now I see how it can be done, by me!"

1672,"This was an excellent class. The instructors clearly put a lot of effort into the class and I am sure they learned a lot as well, which will make future classes from them even more powerful."
1673,I can really recommend this class to anyone that would like to learn about programming in Python! The instructors keeps it really interesting and it's exciting programs that you are building!
1674,"Frustrating yet wonderful mini-projects. It was hard work but I loved it; had several ""aha!"" moments. The professors said that we'd build an asteroids game by week 8 and sure enough we did."
1675,I'm not gonna repeat all things people have already said (you can read it yourself :) ) but just want to thanks Scott and Joe for their tremendous work and effort they have put in this class. THANKS.
1676,"Very enjoyable. The class is simple enough to be very accessible, but has scope to make projects as complex as you wish to be interesting. The projects are fun, but also teach the topics effectively."
1677,"Excellent online class! Instructors provide a very entertaining introduction to programming with python.

It can be difficult to keep up with the weekly assignments - but also very rewarding."
